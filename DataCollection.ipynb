Xcode includes\\nproject management tools; analysis tools to collect, display and compare app\\nperformance data; simulation tools to locally run, test and debug apps; and tools to simplify the design and\\ndevelopment of user interfaces. All developers also have access to extensive technical documentation and sample\\ncode.\\n\\nMarkets and Distribution\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s customers are\\nprimarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company\\nsells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small\\nand mid-sized\\nbusinesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of\\nindirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-\\nadded resellers. During\\n2015, the Company\\x92s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 26% and 74%,\\nrespectively, of total net sales.\\n\\nThe Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable\\nsalespersons who can convey the value of the\\nhardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The\\nCompany further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate\\nthe advantages of its\\nproducts over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is\\ncritical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.\\n\\nTo ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the\\nCompany continues to build and improve its\\ndistribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Company\\x92s retail stores\\nare typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By\\noperating its own\\nstores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high\\nquality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the\\npresentation and\\nmarketing of the Company\\x92s products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable\\npersonnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware,\\nsoftware and other\\naccessories that complement the Company\\x92s products.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 4\\n\\nThe Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures,\\nmerchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple\\nPremium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of\\nproduct expertise,\\nintegration and support services.\\n\\nThe Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes\\neffective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement\\nand has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The\\nCompany also supports\\nmobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education related materials through iTunes U, a\\nplatform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its\\nproducts to the\\neducation market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores.\\n\\nThe Company also sells its hardware\\nand software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable operating segments. The\\nCompany\\x92s products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and\\nseamless integration\\ninto information technology environments. The Company\\x92s products are compatible with thousands of third-party\\nbusiness applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom\\napplications as well as\\nremote device administration.\\n\\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2015, 2014 or 2013.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nThe markets for the Company\\x92s products and\\nservices are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its\\nbusiness. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that\\nhave substantially\\nincreased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital\\nelectronic devices. The Company\\x92s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other\\noperating systems\\nhave aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company\\x92s\\nfinancial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward\\npressures on gross\\nmargins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security\\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party\\nsoftware and\\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.\\n\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its\\nmarket opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are\\nhighly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects\\ncompetition in these markets to\\nintensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Company\\x92s products and\\napplications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are\\nmore competitive than\\nthose they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product\\nintroductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product\\nadvancements by competitors and\\nprice sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s digital content services have faced significant competition from other\\ncompanies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-\\nto-peer music and video services.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company\\x92s ability to continue to\\ndevelop and offer new innovative\\nproducts and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior\\ninnovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple\\nTV), software (iOS, OS X,\\nwatchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Internet Services). Some\\nof the Company\\x92s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such\\nproducts and\\nservices at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company\\x92s offerings.\\n\\nSupply of Components\\n\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\x92s business are generally available from multiple sources, a\\nnumber of components are currently\\nobtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other\\nparticipants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the\\nCompany, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage\\nand significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and\\noperating\\nresults.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 5\\n\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and the Company often\\nutilizes custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\x92 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has\\nincreased. If the\\nCompany\\x92s supply of components were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of\\ncompleted products to the Company, the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results could be materially\\nadversely\\naffected. The Company\\x92s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on\\nthe time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient\\nquantities from\\nan alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected\\nif those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the\\nCompany\\x92s\\nrequirements.\\n\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\\nthe Company will be\\nable to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to\\nsignificant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial\\ncondition and operating\\nresults.\\n\\nWhile some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Company\\x92s hardware\\nproducts are currently\\nmanufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this\\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain\\nof these outsourcing\\npartners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company\\x92s products.\\nAlthough the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company\\x92s\\noperating results could\\nbe adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company\\x92s\\npurchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.\\n\\nResearch and Development\\n\\nBecause the industries in which the\\nCompany competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\\x92s ability to compete successfully\\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and\\ntechnologies to the\\nmarketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range\\nof its product offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses\\nand\\ntechnology. Total R&D expense was $8.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $4.5 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\n\\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses\\n\\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices,\\naccessories, software\\nand services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number\\nof foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and\\nservice marks is an\\nimportant factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies\\nprimarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\n\\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and\\ndesign, and is currently pursuing\\nthousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of\\nissued patents around the world. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and\\nservices. No\\nsingle patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Company\\x92s products. The Company believes the\\nduration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.\\n\\nMany of the Company\\x92s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be\\nnecessary in the future to seek\\nor renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has\\ngenerally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee\\nthat such licenses could be\\nobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which\\nthe Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is\\npossible that certain\\ncomponents of the Company\\x92s products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or\\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\\ncertain patents or\\nother intellectual property rights of third parties.\\n\\nForeign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data\\n\\nDuring 2015, the Company\\x92s domestic and international net sales accounted for 35% and 65%, respectively, of total\\nnet\\nsales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K\\nunder the subheading \\x93Segment Operating Performance,\\x94 and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, \\x93Segment Information and Geographic Data.\\x94\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 6\\n\\nWhile some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Company\\x92s\\nhardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. The supply\\nand manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and\\nEurope. Margins on\\nsales of the Company\\x92s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from\\nforeign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international\\ntrade\\nregulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available\\nsources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \\x93Commitments and Contingencies.\\x94\\n\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\n\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal\\nholiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and\\noperating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Company\\x92s net sales to its indirect distribution\\nchannels as these\\nchannels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a\\nparticular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected\\nwhen consumers and\\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical\\npatterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company\\x92s future pattern of\\nproduct introductions,\\nfuture net sales or financial performance.\\n\\nWarranty\\n\\nThe\\nCompany offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is\\ntypically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a\\n90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company\\x92s hardware products. In certain\\njurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed\\nby statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which\\nextends service coverage on many of the Company\\x92s hardware products.\\n\\nBacklog\\n\\nIn the Company\\x92s experience, the actual amount of\\nproduct backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In\\nparticular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate\\nshortages. Backlog is often\\nreduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be\\nconsidered a reliable indicator of the Company\\x92s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial\\nperformance.\\n\\nEmployees\\n\\nAs of September 26, 2015, the Company had\\napproximately 110,000 full-time equivalent employees.\\n\\nAvailable Information\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\\namendments to reports filed pursuant to\\nSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\x93Exchange Act\\x94), are filed with\\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the \\x93SEC\\x94).

The following information should\\nbe read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \\x93Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults\\nof Operations\\x94 and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \\x93Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data\\x94 of this Form 10-K.\\n\\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors,\\nwhether currently known or unknown,\\nincluding but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause\\nthe Company\\x92s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated\\nfuture, financial\\ncondition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect\\nthe Company\\x92s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\\n\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\\x92s financial condition and\\noperating results, past financial\\nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use\\nhistorical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\\n\\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nUncertainty about global and regional\\neconomic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit,\\nhigher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines\\nin income or\\nasset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse\\neffect on demand for the Company\\x92s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\\x92s\\nexpectations\\nas a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside\\nthe U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence\\nworldwide or\\nregional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets,\\nunemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors\\naffecting consumer\\nspending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\\x92s\\nproducts and services.\\n\\nIn the\\nevent of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the\\nfinancial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be tightening in\\nthe\\ncredit markets, low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This\\ncould have a number of effects on the Company\\x92s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of\\noutsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture\\nproducts resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to\\nfinance purchases\\nof the Company\\x92s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions\\non the Company\\x92s ability to issue new debt. Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations\\ndepending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges\\nresulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; changes in interest rates;\\nincreases or\\ndecreases in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative\\ninstruments. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk\\nof the actual\\namounts realized in the future on the Company\\x92s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values\\ncurrently assigned to them.\\n\\nGlobal markets for the Company\\x92s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s products and services compete in highly competitive global\\nmarkets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent\\nintroduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\\nproduct price/performance\\ncharacteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on\\nthe part of consumers.\\n\\nThe\\nCompany\\x92s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely\\nintroduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is\\nunique in that it\\ndesigns and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in\\nR&D. The Company\\ncurrently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register\\nnumerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\\x92s competitors seek to compete\\nprimarily through\\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company\\x92s products and infringing on its\\nintellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with\\nattractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\\x92s intellectual property, the Company\\x92s ability to\\nmaintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 8\\n\\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system\\nand also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in\\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well\\nas established\\nhardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the\\nglobal smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their\\nselling prices and\\nattempt to imitate the Company\\x92s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively,\\ncollaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The\\nCompany competes with\\nbusiness models that include content provided to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways\\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Company\\x92s competitors have greater experience,\\nproduct breadth\\nand distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial\\nresources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little\\nor no profit or even at a\\nloss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\\x92s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated\\nsolutions. The\\nCompany\\x92s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\\x92s ability to continually\\nimprove iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.\\n\\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal\\ncomputer market. This market has been\\ncontracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the\\nmarket for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which\\nhave broader product\\nlines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has\\nresulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-\\nbased personal computers\\nhave aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that\\ninclude software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market\\nshare with the\\nCompany\\x92s existing products. The Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to\\ncontinually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.\\n\\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete\\neffectively.\\n\\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product\\nintroductions and transitions.\\n\\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\\ncontinually introduce new\\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand\\nfor new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The\\nsuccess of new product\\nintroductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product\\ndevelopment, market acceptance, the Company\\x92s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production\\nramp-up issues, the\\navailability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and\\ninventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities\\nand at expected costs to\\nmeet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the\\nearly stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new\\nproduct introductions and\\ntransitions.\\n\\nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.\\n\\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional\\nretailers and value-added resellers, many of\\nwhom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products\\nin most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and\\nmid-sized\\nbusinesses through its online and retail stores.\\n\\nCarriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users\\x92 purchases of\\nthe device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal\\nof the Company\\x92s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 9\\n\\nMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic\\nconditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\\x92s direct sales as conflicting with their\\nbusiness interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\\x92s products. Such a perception could discourage\\nresellers from\\ninvesting resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\\x92s products or lead them to limit or cease\\ndistribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance\\nreseller sales, including\\nstaffing selected resellers\\x92 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement\\ndisplays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or\\nincremental revenue. The\\nfinancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\\x92s\\nproducts, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\\x92s products could cause resellers to reduce\\ntheir ordering\\nand marketing of the Company\\x92s products.\\n\\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\\n\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\\nanticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess\\nproducts and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its\\nsuppliers\\x92 facilities\\nand inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset\\nmay not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to\\nthe amount by which\\nthe carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to\\ninventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate,\\nno assurance can be\\ngiven that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product\\nobsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\\n\\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and\\nshipments. Consistent with industry\\npractice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open\\norders, in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component\\nprepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted\\ncomponent and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\\x92s markets are volatile,\\ncompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize\\nfirm purchase commitments.\\n\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\\x92s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.\\n\\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many\\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the\\nsupply of many components,\\nthere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at\\nall. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business\\nfailure for the\\nsupplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\\x92s ability to obtain sufficient\\nquantities of components. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\\x92s suppliers,\\ndescribed\\nin \\x93Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\\x94 above, also could affect\\nthe Company\\x92s ability to obtain components.Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks\\nof supply shortages and price increases.\\n\\nThe Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal\\ncomputers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for\\ntheir products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The\\nCompany\\x92s new\\nproducts often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\x92 yields have matured or manufacturing\\ncapacity has increased.\\nContinued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of\\nreasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\\ncomponents customized to meet\\nthe Company\\x92s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained,\\nor a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 10\\n\\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\n\\nSubstantially all of the Company\\x92s manufacturing is performed in\\nwhole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of\\nits transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce\\nthe Company\\x92s\\ndirect control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on\\nthe quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\\x92s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.\\nAlthough\\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain\\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an\\nunanticipated product defect\\nor warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material\\nviolations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\\n\\nThe Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\\ncritical components, and on\\noutsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\\x92s hardware\\nproducts. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\\x92s cost or supply of\\ncomponents\\nor finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may\\nbe disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information\\ntechnology system\\nfailures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or\\npolitical issues.\\n\\nThe Company has\\ninvested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has\\nmade prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements\\nhelp ensure the\\nsupply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial\\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net\\nrealizable value of\\nthese assets could be negatively impacted.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased\\nsales and operating margin and harm to the Company\\x92s reputation.\\n\\nThe Company sells complex hardware and\\nsoftware products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system\\nsoftware and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \\x93bugs\\x94 that can unexpectedly interfere\\nwith the\\nsoftware\\x92s intended operation. The Company\\x92s online services may from time to time experience outages, service\\nslowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.\\nThere can be\\nno assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it\\nsells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the\\nCompany\\x92s reputation.\\n\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\\n\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content. This includes the right to sell\\ncurrently\\navailable music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third\\nparties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\\nreasonable terms, if at\\nall. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products\\nand services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise\\ndistribute their\\ncontent in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\\x92s access to,\\nor increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at\\nreasonable\\nprices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make\\navailable third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could\\nhave a material\\nadverse impact on the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to\\nprovide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to\\ndevelop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to\\ndevelop or license such\\nsolutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose\\nand adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the\\nprotection of\\ncontent and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\\x92s content\\nproviders.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 11\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s future performance depends in part on support from third-partysoftware developers.\\n\\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware\\nproducts depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no\\nassurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and\\nservices for the Company\\x92s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and\\nmaintained for the Company\\x92s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\\x92s products.\\n\\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and\\nservices depends in part on the developers\\x92 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing,\\nmaintaining and upgrading such software for the Company\\x92s products compared to Windows-based products. This\\nanalysis may be based\\non factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be\\ngenerated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the\\nCompany\\x92s minority\\nshare of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac\\x92s prospects, developers could be\\nless inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\\x92s Mac products and more inclined to devote their\\nresources to\\ndeveloping and upgrading software for the larger Windows market.\\n\\nWith respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and\\ndevelopment of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution\\nchannel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are\\nunable to or choose\\nnot to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in\\ndissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company\\x92s Mac products, the availability and development of\\nthese\\napplications also depend on developers\\x92 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing,\\nmaintaining or upgrading software for the Company\\x92s iOS devices rather than its competitors\\x92 platforms, such as\\nAndroid. If\\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\\nCompany\\x92s iOS devices may suffer.\\n\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\\n\\nMany of the Company\\x92s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third\\nparties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be\\nobtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on\\nacceptable terms or at all.\\nFailure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a\\nmaterial adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\x92s financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on\\nintellectual property rights.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that\\nhave not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may\\narise in the future.\\n\\nFor\\nexample, technology companies, including many of the Company\\x92s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based\\non allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent\\nholding companies\\nseek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual\\nproperty rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company\\x92s\\ncellular enabled products\\ncompete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios,\\nand the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased. The Company is vigorously\\ndefending\\ninfringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade\\nCommission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek\\ninjunctions and substantial\\ndamages.\\n\\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any\\nclaims by potential or\\nactual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one\\nor more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing\\ntechnology, it may be\\nrequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent\\ninjunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products.\\n\\nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no\\nassurance can be given that such licenses\\ncan be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly\\nincrease the Company\\x92s operating expenses.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 12\\n\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the\\nCompany\\x92s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter\\ninto arrangements to settle litigation.\\n\\nIn management\\x92s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material\\nloss, or a material loss in excess\\nof a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of\\nintellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\\n\\nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were\\nresolved against the Company in a\\nreporting period for amounts in excess of management\\x92s expectations, the Company\\x92s consolidated financial\\nstatements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result\\nin significant\\ncompensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures\\nor injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and\\noperating results.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\\x92s costs and\\nindividually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company\\x92s business.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and\\ninternational operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\\x92s\\nactivities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection,\\nreal estate,\\nbilling, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media,\\ntelevision, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption,\\nforeign exchange controls\\nand cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.\\n\\nBy way of example, laws and\\nregulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company\\noperates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the\\nproduction, manufacture,\\ndistribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\\x92s network, or mandating the use of devices on more\\nthan one carrier\\x92s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and\\nstandardization\\nbodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are\\nextensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays\\nin product shipment\\ndates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.\\n\\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous\\nand expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of\\ncompliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws\\nand regulations or in\\ntheir interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\\x92s products and services less\\nattractive to the Company\\x92s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the\\nCompany to change\\nor limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance\\nwith applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\\x92s employees, contractors, or\\nagents will not\\nviolate such laws and regulations or the Company\\x92s policies and procedures.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s business is subject to the risks of international operations.\\n\\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance\\nwith applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption\\nlaws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements,\\nenvironmental laws, labor laws\\nand anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the\\nCompany has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the\\nCompany\\x92s employees,\\ncontractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\x92s brand, international growth efforts and business.\\n\\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including,\\nbut not limited to, economic and\\nlabor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the\\nCompany\\x92s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign\\nsuppliers, could be\\nmaterially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping\\npenalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in\\ncertain international\\nmarkets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 13\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s retail stores have required\\nsubstantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The\\nCompany also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been\\ndesigned and built to\\nserve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing\\nactivities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more\\ninvestment than the\\nCompany\\x92s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\\x92s retail stores, a\\ndecline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant\\nlease\\ntermination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\\n\\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which\\nare beyond the Company\\x92s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not\\nlimited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the\\nCompany\\x92s\\ninability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company\\x92s failure to manage\\nrelationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations\\noutside the U.S., costs\\nassociated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company\\x92s inability to obtain\\nand renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\\n\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\\x92s ongoing business and present\\nrisks not originally contemplated.\\n\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\\nmay involve\\nsignificant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than\\nexpected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the\\nCompany\\x92s due\\ndiligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network\\ndisruptions.\\n\\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system\\nfailures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions,\\ntelecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other\\nevents or disruptions.\\nSystem redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\\x92s disaster recovery planning may not be\\nsufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the\\nCompany\\x92s online\\nstores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed\\nor cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products,\\ndelivery of online\\nservices, transactions processing and financial reporting.\\n\\nThere may be breaches of the Company\\x92s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and\\ncustomer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the\\nCompany to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable\\ninformation\\n(\\x93PII\\x94). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact\\npreferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access\\nto PII affect\\nmany companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of\\nits high profile and the amount of PII it manages.\\n\\nThe Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company\\nalso uses encryption and authentication\\ntechnologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or\\naccounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee\\nerror, malfeasance, faulty\\npassword management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce\\nemployees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be\\nused to access the\\nCompany\\x92s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts\\nand systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the\\ndelay or loss of\\ncustomer orders.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 14\\n\\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures\\nto protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the\\nCompany was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could\\nmaterially damage\\nbusiness partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and\\nservices. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\\x92s systems or results in the unauthorized\\nrelease of PII,\\nthe Company\\x92s reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Company\\x92s products and services could\\ndecrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the\\nCompany maintains\\ninsurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured\\nretention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\\ncover all losses or all types\\nof claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\\nobligations regarding data protection.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and\\ninternational laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these\\nlaws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its\\nsubsidiaries, and\\namong the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several\\njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional\\nrestrictions. These laws continue\\nto develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\\ninternational requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its\\nbusiness practices.\\nNoncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s privacy policy, which includes related practices\\nconcerning the use and disclosure of data, is posted on its website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or\\nother parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal,\\nstate or\\ninternational privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the\\nCompany by governmental entities or others.\\n\\nThe Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card\\nprocessors. Under these rules and\\nobligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated\\nexpenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even\\nif no customer\\ninformation is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in\\npayment card transaction costs.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\\n\\nMuch of the Company\\x92s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including\\nits Chief Executive Officer,\\nexecutive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high\\ndemand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\\x92s key\\npersonnel are\\nlocated.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters\\nand other business interruptions.\\n\\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused\\nand could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers,\\nincluding channel partners.\\nThe Company\\x92s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a\\nresult of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and\\nother hostile\\nacts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand\\nfor the Company\\x92s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its\\ncustomers,\\nincluding channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in\\nthe Company\\x92s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be\\nadversely affected\\nby more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions\\nlimiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in\\nthe operations of the\\nCompany\\x92s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\\x92s R&D activities, its\\ncorporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain\\ncomponent\\nsuppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of\\na natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience\\nsignificant\\nexpenditures in order to resume operations.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 15\\n\\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company\\x92s software,\\naccessories, and service and support\\ncontracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\\x92s other products. Gross margins on the\\nCompany\\x92s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions,\\npricing and\\nconfiguration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\\x92s direct sales generally\\nhave higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the\\nCompany\\x92s gross\\nmargin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as\\na result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar,\\nprice competition,\\nor the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.\\n\\nThe Company has typically\\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday\\ndemand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating\\nexpenses. Further, the\\nCompany generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could\\nsignificantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a\\nquarter, such as\\nlower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\\x92s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal\\nsystems failure, or failure of one of the Company\\x92s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s stock price is subject to volatility.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\\nfuture. Additionally, the\\nCompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume\\nfluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\\x92 operating\\nperformance. Price\\nvolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed\\nthe stock\\x92s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of\\nfuture growth\\nand profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend\\nwill continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated.\\nFuture dividends are\\nsubject to declaration by the Company\\x92s Board of Directors, and the Company\\x92s share repurchase program does not\\nobligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future\\ngrowth,\\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline\\nsignificantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\\nversus local currencies.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-\\ndenominated sales\\nand operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the\\nU.S. dollar value of the Company\\x92s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company\\nto raise\\ninternational pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\\x92s products. Margins on sales of the Company\\x92s\\nproducts in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers,\\ncould be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for\\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\\x92s\\nstrengthening, or at all, which\\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\x92s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\\nCompany\\x92s\\nforeign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur\\nlosses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of\\nforeign currencies\\nmay also increase the Company\\x92s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\\naffecting gross margins.\\n\\nThe Company\\nuses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more\\nthan a portion, of the\\nadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.\\n\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.\\n\\nGiven the global nature of its business, the\\nCompany has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company\\x92s investments\\ncan be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk,\\nsovereign risk or\\nother factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\\x92s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\\nsecurities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on\\nits cash, cash\\nequivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized\\nloss.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 16\\n\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\\nconditions worsen.\\n\\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\\nvalue-added resellers. The Company also\\nsells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A\\nsubstantial majority of the Company\\x92s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party\\nfinancing\\narrangements or credit insurance. The Company\\x92s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables\\nis higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also\\nhas unsecured\\nvendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that\\nmanufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made\\nprepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2015, a significant\\nportion of the Company\\x92s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-\\ntrade\\nreceivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors\\nlocated primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its\\ntrade and vendor\\nnon-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively\\nlimit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\n\\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation\\nor exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\\nof the Company\\x92s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various\\njurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\\x92s effective tax rates could be affected by changes\\nin the mix of\\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. For example, in\\nJune 2014, the European\\nCommission opened a formal investigation of Ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard\\nto the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Company\\x92s Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules\\non state aid.\\nIf the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, it could require Ireland to recover from the Company\\npast taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be\\nmaterial.\\n\\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue\\nService and other tax authorities and\\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these\\nexaminations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of\\nthese examinations. If\\nthe Company\\x92s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate\\ndetermination of the Company\\x92s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\x92s\\nfinancial\\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 17\\n                                       \\n  Item\\xa01B.

Properties  \\n                       \\nThe Company\\x92s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of\\nSeptember 26, 2015, the Company owned or leased 25.6 million square feet of building space, primarily in the U.S.\\nThe Company also owned or leased building space in various locations, including throughout Europe, China, Singapore\\nand\\nJapan. Of the total owned or leased building space 18.5 million square feet was leased building space, which\\nincludes approximately 5.3 million square feet related to retail store space. Additionally, the Company owns a\\ntotal of 1,757\\nacres of land in various locations.\\n\\nAs of September 26, 2015, the Company owned a manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland that also housed a\\ncustomer support call center; facilities in Elk Grove, California that included warehousing and distribution\\noperations and a customer support call center; and a facility in Mesa, Arizona. The Company also owned land in\\nAustin, Texas where it is\\nexpanding its existing office space and customer support call center. In addition, the Company owned facilities and\\nland for R&D and corporate functions in San Jose, California and Cupertino, California, including land that is\\nbeing developed\\nfor the Company\\x92s second corporate campus. The Company also owned data centers in Newark, California; Maiden, North\\nCarolina; Prineville, Oregon; and Reno, Nevada. Outside the U.S., the Company owned additional facilities for\\nvarious purposes.\\n\\nThe Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all operating segments, are in good\\noperating condition and are\\nsuitable for the conduct of its business. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships\\nwith outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet\\nanticipated demand for\\nits products.\\n                              \\n  Item\\xa03.  Legal Proceedings  \\n                              \\nThe Company is subject to the legal proceedings and claims discussed below as\\nwell as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the\\nordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the\\nCompany may have incurred\\na material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for\\nasserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company\\nis subject to significant\\nuncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or\\nmore of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\\nmanagement\\x92s\\nexpectations, the Company\\x92s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially\\nadversely affected.

Apple Inc., et al.)\\n\\nOn April 11, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil\\nantitrust action against the Company and five major book publishers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\\nDistrict of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of §1 of the\\nSherman Act and\\nseeking, among other things, injunctive relief, the District Court\\x92s declaration that the Company\\x92s agency\\nagreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the District Court\\x92s reformation of such agreements. On\\nJuly 10,\\n2013, the District Court found, following a bench trial, that the Company conspired to restrain trade in violation\\nof §1 of the Sherman Act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with §1 of the Sherman\\nAct. The District Court entered a permanent injunction, which took effect on October 6, 2013 and will be in effect\\nfor five years unless the judgment is overturned on appeal.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update\\nany forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\n\\nOverview and Highlights\\n\\nThe Company designs, manufactures and\\nmarkets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a\\nvariety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and\\napplications. The Company\\nsells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through\\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company\\nsells a variety of\\nthird-party Apple compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its online\\nand retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers.\\n\\nFiscal 2015 Highlights\\n\\nNet sales rose 28% or $50.9\\nbillion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in iPhone net sales. iPhone net sales\\nand unit sales in 2015 increased in all of the Company\\x92s reportable\\noperating segments. The Company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in Mac, Services and Other\\nProducts. Apple Watch,\\nwhich launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net\\nsales of Other Products. Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most\\nforeign currencies\\nrelative to the U.S. dollar and lower iPad net sales. Total net sales increased in each of the Company\\x92s reportable\\noperating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater China\\nwhere year-over-year net sales increased 84%.\\n\\nIn April 2015, the Company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising\\nthe expected total size of the program to $200 billion through March 2017. This included increasing its share\\nrepurchase authorization to $140 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share beginning in May\\n2015. During 2015, the\\nCompany spent $36.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of\\n$11.6 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $14.5 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated,\\n\\x804.8 billion of euro-denominated, SFr1.3 billion of Swiss franc-denominated, £1.3 billion of British pound-\\ndenominated, A$2.3 billion of Australian dollar-denominated and ¥250.0 billion\\nof Japanese yen-denominated term debt during 2015.\\n\\nFiscal 2014 Highlights\\n\\nNet sales rose 7% or $11.9 billion during 2014 compared to 2013. This was driven by increases in net sales of\\niPhone, Mac and Services. Net sales and unit\\nsales increased for iPhone primarily due to the successful introduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in the latter half of\\ncalendar year 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, and\\nexpanded distribution.\\nMac net sales and unit sales increased primarily due to strong demand for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro which were\\nupdated in 2014 with\\nfaster processors and offered at lower prices. Net sales of Services grew primarily due to increased revenue from\\nsales through the App Store, AppleCare and licensing. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the year-over-\\nyear decline in net sales for iPad due to lower unit sales in many markets, and a decline in net sales of Other\\nProducts.

In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to\\ntake product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by\\nthe Company\\x92s\\nability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its\\nproducts.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company had a total of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail space\\nare for terms\\nranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal\\noptions. As of September 26, 2015, the Company\\x92s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating\\nleases were $6.3\\nbillion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.\\n\\nPurchase Commitments\\n\\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\\x92s products and to\\nperform final assembly and testing\\nof finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information\\nsupplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual\\ncomponents for its products\\nfrom a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components\\nthrough a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand\\ninformation. Where\\nappropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective\\nsupplier. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party\\nmanufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5 billion.\\n\\nOther Obligations\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s other off-balance sheet obligations were comprised of commitments to acquire capital assets,\\nincluding product tooling and\\nmanufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, R&D,\\ninternet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax\\nliabilities, gross unrecognized tax\\nbenefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had non-current\\ndeferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion. Additionally, as of September 26, 2015, the Company had gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits\\nof $6.9 billion and an additional $1.3 billion for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current\\nliabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments\\nin individual years in\\nconnection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation\\ntable.\\n\\nIndemnification\\n\\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal\\nclaims that the software infringes\\nthird-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include\\nindemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an\\ninfringement claim against the\\nCompany or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable\\npossibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its\\noperating system or application\\nsoftware for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for\\ninfringement costs related to indemnification as of September 26, 2015 or September 27, 2014.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 32\\n\\nIn September 2015, the Company introduced the iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who\\npurchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of its U.S. physical retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with\\none of the four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone\\nfor a new iPhone,\\nprovided certain conditions are met. One of the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the\\ninitial purchase price of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of\\na new iPhone, the\\nCompany satisfies the customer\\x92s outstanding balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. The\\nCompany accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair\\nvalue of such\\nright with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.\\n\\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\\ndirectors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to\\nthe fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or\\nofficers and to advance\\nexpenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine\\nthe maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the\\nlimited history of\\nprior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company\\nmaintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of\\nfinancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\n(\\x93GAAP\\x94) and the Company\\x92s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the\\nCompany\\x92s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \\x93Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\\x94 of\\nthe Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting\\npolicies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\x92s consolidated financial statements. Management bases\\nits estimates on\\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual\\nresults may differ from\\nthese estimates, and such differences may be material.\\n\\nManagement believes the Company\\x92s critical accounting policies and estimates are those\\nrelated to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and\\nvaluation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs,\\nincome taxes, and legal and\\nother contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal\\nof the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and\\nestimates about\\ninherently uncertain matters. The Company\\x92s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and\\nrelated disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\\x92s Board of Directors.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue\\nfrom the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support\\ncontracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred,\\nthe sales price is fixed\\nor determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been\\nshipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\\x92s product\\nsales, these criteria\\nare met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers\\nin the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product\\nbecause the Company\\nretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company\\x92s\\nstandard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that\\nthe sales price\\nis fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable\\narrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware\\nthat is essential to the\\nfunctionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general\\nrevenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific\\nsoftware accounting\\nguidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of\\nsoftware upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the\\nhardware.\\n\\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware\\nproduct\\x92s functionality,\\nundelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\\x92s essential software and/or undelivered non-\\nsoftware services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In\\nsuch circumstances,\\nthe Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\\nvendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\\x93VSOE\\x94), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price\\n(\\x93TPE\\x94) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\\x93ESP\\x94). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the\\ndeliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the\\nCompany\\x92s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-\\nalone basis.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 33\\n\\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it\\nmay from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device\\x92s essential software and/or non-\\nsoftware services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade\\nrights or the\\nnon-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\\x92s ESPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\\x92s ESPs is\\ndeferred and\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are\\nexpected to be provided.\\n\\nThe\\nCompany\\x92s process for determining ESPs involves management\\x92s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary\\nover time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and\\ncircumstances change, the Company\\x92s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software\\nupgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change\\ninclude the\\nunspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software\\nupgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software\\nservices are expected\\nto be provided.\\n\\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer\\nincentive\\nprograms. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount\\nto be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for\\nrevenue recognition\\nhave been met. The Company\\x92s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not\\nrecognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\\x92s other customer\\nincentive programs,\\nthe estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at\\nwhich the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns\\nbased on the\\nCompany\\x92s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to\\nincrease customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain\\ncustomer incentive\\nprograms require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.\\nManagement\\x92s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular\\nincentive programs. If a\\ngreater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record\\nadditional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\\x92s operating results.\\n\\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities\\n\\nThe\\nCompany\\x92s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses\\nrelated to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of\\ntax, in the\\nCompany\\x92s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the\\nCompany\\x92s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized.\\nRealized gains and\\nlosses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\\x92s cost basis. The\\nCompany regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired,\\nwhich would\\nrequire the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this\\njudgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security\\nis less than its cost;\\nthe financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\\x92s intent to sell, or whether it will\\nmore likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\\x92s\\nassessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new\\ndevelopments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on\\nthe Company\\x92s operating\\nresults.\\n\\nInventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation\\nFees\\n\\nThe Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in\\nmanufacturing-related assets, including\\ncapital assets held at its suppliers\\x92 facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its\\nsuppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records\\na write-down\\nfor inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become\\nobsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of\\ninventory that considers\\nmultiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales\\nlevels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory\\nprepayments for\\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If\\nthe Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which\\nthe carrying value\\nof such an asset exceeds its fair value.\\n\\nThe industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and\\ncomponent obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record\\nadditional write-downs of inventory and/or manufacturing-related assets. These circumstances include future demand\\nor market conditions for the\\nCompany\\x92s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the\\nCompany\\x92s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant\\ndeterioration in the\\nfinancial condition of one or more of the Company\\x92s suppliers that hold any of the Company\\x92s manufacturing-related\\nassets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the\\nCompany\\x92s\\nfinancial condition and operating results in the period when the write-downs were recorded.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 34\\n\\nThe Company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or\\nare expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a\\ncombination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Where\\nappropriate, the purchases\\nare applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. Purchase\\ncommitments typically cover the Company\\x92s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150\\ndays. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\\x92s products, a change\\nin the Company\\x92s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the\\nCompany\\x92s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would\\nadversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.\\n\\nWarranty Costs\\n\\nThe Company accrues for the estimated cost of\\nwarranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates,\\nhistorical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the\\nCompany\\x92s typical\\nexperience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty\\nliabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as\\nnecessary. If actual product\\nfailure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be\\nrequired and could materially affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nThe Company records a tax provision for the\\nanticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using\\nthe asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected\\nfuture tax consequences\\nof temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating\\nlosses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted\\ntax rates that\\napply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be\\nrealized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is\\nbelieved more likely than\\nnot to be realized.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax\\nposition will\\nbe sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\\nbenefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit\\nthat has a greater than\\n50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\\n\\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income\\nthat may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing\\ntaxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the\\nCompany determines all\\nor part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to\\nthe valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition,\\nthe calculation of tax\\nliabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and\\ncomplex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\\x92s expectations could\\nhave a material\\nimpact on the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\n\\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \\x93Legal Proceedings\\x94 and in Part II, Item 8 of\\nthis Form 10-K in the\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \\x93Commitments and Contingencies,\\x94 the Company is subject to\\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability\\nwhen it\\nis probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment\\nrequired in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the\\nopinion of management,\\nthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss\\nin excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However,\\nthe outcome of legal\\nproceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although\\nmanagement considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were\\nresolved against the\\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\\x92s expectations, the Company\\x92s consolidated\\nfinancial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 35\\n                                                                        \\n  Item\\xa07A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  \\n                                                                        \\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\\n\\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\\nstand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures.\\nGiven the effective horizons of the Company\\x92s risk management activities and the anticipatory\\nnature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial\\nimpact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains\\nand losses\\nrelated to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying\\neconomic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s exposure to changes in\\ninterest rates relates primarily to the Company\\x92s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is\\nexposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\\x92s interest income and expense are most sensitive to\\nfluctuations in\\nU.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\\x92s cash, cash\\nequivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with\\nhedging and interest paid\\non the Company\\x92s debt.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the\\nCompany\\x92s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its\\ninvestment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated\\nsecurities, and its\\ninvestment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments\\ngenerally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To\\nprovide a\\nmeaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\\x92s investment portfolio, the Company\\nperformed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the\\ninvestment\\nportfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of\\nSeptember 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all\\nmaturities would\\nresult in a $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio,\\nrespectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\\n\\nAs of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with\\nvarying maturities for an\\naggregate carrying amount of $56.0 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter\\nin the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate\\nswaps allow the\\nCompany to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into\\nfixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and\\ngains on the related\\nhedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the\\nCompany\\x92s debt as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 to increase by $200 million and $110 million on an\\nannualized\\nbasis, respectively.\\n\\nFurther details regarding the Company\\x92s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, \\x93Debt.\\x94\\n\\nForeign Currency Risk\\n\\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in\\nexchange rates, and in particular a\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\\x92s net sales and gross margins as expressed in\\nU.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to\\ncompetitive pressures\\nwhen there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\\n\\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\\ncontracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing\\nassets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in\\nforeign subsidiaries.\\nIn addition, the Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into non-designated foreign currency contracts\\nto partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The\\nCompany\\x92s\\npractice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However,\\nthe Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not\\nlimited to\\naccounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 36\\n\\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the\\nCompany\\x92s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk\\n(\\x93VAR\\x94) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a\\nMonte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The\\nVAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\x92s foreign currency\\nderivative\\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\\nas a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm\\ncommitments and\\nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the\\nmodel, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of\\nSeptember 26, 2015\\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of September 27, 2014. Because the Company uses\\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are\\ngenerally offset by\\nincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\\n\\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\\x92s investment portfolio and\\nderivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26, 2015 due to\\nthe inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign\\ncurrency\\nexchanges rates and the Company\\x92s actual exposures and positions.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 37\\n                                                        \\n  Item\\xa08.

Financial Statements.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 43\\n\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nNote 1 \\x96 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nApple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively \\x93Apple\\x94 or the \\x93Company\\x94) designs, manufactures and\\nmarkets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a\\nvariety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and\\napplications. The Company\\nsells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through\\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company\\nsells a variety of\\nthird-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its online\\nand retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers.\\n\\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\\n\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and\\ntransactions have\\nbeen eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\\x92s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all\\nadjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\\npreparation of these\\nconsolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\x93GAAP\\x94)\\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated\\nfinancial statements\\nand accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that\\nends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\\x92s fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on September 26, 2015,\\nSeptember 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, respectively. An additional week is included in the first fiscal\\nquarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal years 2015, 2014\\nand 2013 each spanned 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\\nperiods refer to the\\nCompany\\x92s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications,\\naccessories, and service\\nand support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery\\nhas occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered\\nto the customer once\\nit has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the\\nCompany\\x92s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to\\nindividuals, for some sales to\\neducation customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer\\nreceives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For\\npayment terms in excess of\\nthe Company\\x92s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive\\nevidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without\\nconcession, on\\ncomparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with\\nhardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes\\nStore in accordance\\nwith general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry\\nspecific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of\\nsoftware products,\\n(ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the\\nfunctionality of the hardware.\\n\\nFor\\nthe sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers\\nbecause the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical\\nproducts, is the\\nprimary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes\\nStore, the Company does\\nnot determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the\\nCompany accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each\\nsale. The portion of\\nthe gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain\\ndigital content owners is not reflected in the Company\\x92s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 44\\n\\nThe Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the\\nperformance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software\\nupgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells\\ngift cards redeemable at\\nits retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store and\\niBooks Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale\\nof the card, which is\\nrelieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is\\ndeferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically\\ninclude extended phone\\nsupport, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Company\\x92s standard\\nlimited warranty.\\n\\nThe Company\\nrecords reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive\\nprograms. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount\\nto be refunded. For\\nthe Company\\x92s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of\\nthe date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also\\nrecords\\nreductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\\x92s historical experience. Revenue is\\nrecorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected\\ntaxes recorded\\nas current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\\n\\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware\\nproduct\\x92s functionality, undelivered\\nsoftware elements that relate to the hardware product\\x92s essential software, and undelivered non-software services,\\nthe Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances,\\nthe Company uses\\na hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific\\nobjective evidence of fair value (\\x93VSOE\\x94), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (\\x93TPE\\x94) and\\n(iii) best estimate of selling price (\\x93ESP\\x94). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable\\nseparately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\\x92s best\\nestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For\\nmulti-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the\\nCompany allocates\\nrevenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized\\nwhen elements lacking VSOE are delivered.\\n\\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch (\\x93iOS devices\\x94), Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the\\nCompany has indicated it\\nmay from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device\\x92s essential software and/or non-\\nsoftware services free of charge. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in\\narrangements involving\\nthe sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales\\nprice, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of\\nsale. The second\\ndeliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis,\\nfuture unspecified software upgrades relating to the product\\x92s essential software. The third deliverable is the\\nnon-software\\nservices to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the\\nrelative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation\\nof revenue is based\\non the Company\\x92s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized\\nat the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the\\nembedded\\nunspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\\nbasis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost\\nof sales related to\\ndelivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time\\nof sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and\\nengineering and sales and\\nmarketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE\\nor TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each\\ndeliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar\\nofferings, product\\nspecific business objectives, length of time a particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost to\\nprovide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared\\nto the total\\nselling price of the product.\\n\\nBeginning in September 2015, the Company reduced the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to\\nreflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at little to no cost for users, which reduces the\\namount the Company could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone basis.\\n\\nShipping Costs\\n\\nAmounts billed to customers related to shipping\\nand handling are classified as revenue, and the Company\\x92s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of\\nsales.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 45\\n\\nWarranty Costs\\n\\nThe Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related\\nrevenue is recognized. The Company\\nassesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual\\nexperience and changes in future estimates.\\n\\nSoftware Development Costs\\n\\nResearch and development\\n(\\x93R&D\\x94) costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise\\nmarketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product\\x92s technological feasibility has been established\\nand\\nending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company\\x92s products are\\nreleased soon after technological feasibility has been established and as a result software development costs were\\nexpensed as\\nincurred.\\n\\nAdvertising Costs\\n\\nAdvertising costs are\\nexpensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was $1.8\\nbillion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\n\\nShare-based Compensation\\n\\nThe Company recognizes expense\\nrelated to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity\\ninstruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Company\\x92s equity instruments\\nor that\\nmay be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and\\nrestricted stock units (\\x93RSUs\\x94) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company\\x92s common stock on\\nthe\\ndate of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the award\\x92s requisite service period on a\\nstraight-line basis for time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of\\nperformance\\nconditions. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of\\nShareholders\\x92 Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects\\nof share-based\\ncompensation on R&D tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated\\nStatements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, \\x93Benefit\\nPlans.\\x94\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nThe provision for income taxes is computed\\nusing the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the\\nexpected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets\\nand liabilities and for\\noperating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently\\nenacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities\\nare expected to be\\nrealized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is\\nbelieved more likely than not to be realized.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax\\nposition will be sustained on\\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized\\nin the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater\\nthan 50% likelihood\\nof being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, \\x93Income Taxes\\x94 for additional information.\\n\\nEarnings Per Share\\n\\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average\\nnumber of shares of common stock\\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common\\nshareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to\\ninclude the number of\\nadditional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been\\nissued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the\\nCompany\\x92s employee\\nstock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive\\nsecurities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the\\ntreasury stock method, an\\nincrease in the fair market value of the Company\\x92s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from\\npotentially dilutive securities.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 46\\n\\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2015, 2014 and 2013\\n(net income in millions and shares in thousands):\\n                                                                                       \\n  Numerator:                                     2015            2014            2013  \\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n  Net income                             $     53,394    $     39,510    $     37,037  \\n  Denominator:                                                                         \\n  Weighted-average shares outstanding       5,753,421       6,085,572       6,477,320  \\n  Effect of dilutive securities                39,648          37,091          44,314  \\n  Weighted-average diluted shares           5,793,069       6,122,663       6,521,634  \\n  Basic earnings per share               $       9.28    $       6.49    $       5.72  \\n  Diluted earnings per share             $       9.22    $       6.45    $       5.68  \\n                                                                                       \\nPotentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of\\ndiluted\\nearnings per share.\\n\\nFinancial Instruments\\n\\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\n\\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\\ncash\\nequivalents. The Company\\x92s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as\\navailable-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate\\nclassification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet\\ndate. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\\ninstrument\\x92s\\nunderlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are\\nclassified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as\\nlong-term. Marketable equity\\nsecurities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each\\nsecurity and its availability for use in current operations. The Company\\x92s marketable debt and equity securities\\nare carried at\\nfair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income (\\x93AOCI\\x94) in shareholders\\x92 equity, with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be\\nother-than-temporary which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of securities sold is based\\nupon the specific identification method.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\n\\nThe Company accounts for its\\nderivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.\\n\\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to\\nvariability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the\\ngain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders\\x92 equity and\\nreclassified into earnings\\nin the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the\\ngain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the current period. To receive\\nhedge accounting\\ntreatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged\\ntransactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the\\nassessment of hedge\\neffectiveness and are recognized in earnings.\\n\\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a\\nliability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as\\nwell as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.\\n\\nFor derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency\\nexchange rates used for translation of the\\nnet investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on\\nthe effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation\\nadjustment. For\\nforward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating\\nto changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses\\nrelated to this\\nforward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.\\n\\nDerivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value\\nthrough earnings in the current period.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 47\\n\\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\\n\\nThe Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including\\nhistorical experience, age of the accounts\\nreceivable balances, credit quality of the Company\\x92s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that\\nmay affect the customers\\x92 ability to pay.\\n\\nInventories\\n\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost,\\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of\\ninventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of September 26,\\n2015 and\\nSeptember 27, 2014, the Company\\x92s inventories consist primarily of finished goods.\\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over\\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of\\nthe underlying building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and\\nmanufacturing process\\nequipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible\\ncosts to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage.\\nCapitalized costs\\nrelated to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\\nthe assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment\\nwas $9.2 billion, $6.9\\nbillion and $5.8 billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\\n\\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\\n\\nThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable\\nintangibles, excluding goodwill, for\\nimpairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the\\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of\\ntheir carrying amounts\\nto future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory\\ncomponent prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be\\nrecognized equals the\\namount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.\\n\\nThe Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with\\nindefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner\\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its\\ngoodwill and intangible\\nasset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges\\nrelated to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company established\\nreporting units based on\\nits current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to\\nthese reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the Company\\x92s goodwill was\\nprimarily\\nallocated to the Americas and Europe reporting units.\\n\\nThe Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated\\nuseful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible\\nassets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.\\n\\nFair Value Measurements\\n\\nThe Company applies fair value\\naccounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or\\ndisclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the\\nprice that would be\\nreceived from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\\nparticipants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities,\\nwhich are required to be recorded\\nat fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact\\nand the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or\\nliability, such as\\nrisks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying\\nthe following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the\\ncategorization within\\nthe hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\\n\\nLevel 1\\x96 Quoted prices in active markets\\nfor identical assets or liabilities.\\n\\nLevel 2\\x96 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and\\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that\\nare observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\\nliabilities.\\n\\nLevel 3\\x96 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\x92s estimate of assumptions that\\nmarket participants\\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 48\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain\\nmarketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nThe valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company\\x92s debt instruments and all other financial\\ninstruments,\\nall of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model\\ndriven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\\n\\nIn accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial\\ninstruments and certain other items at fair\\nvalue. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.\\n\\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\\n\\nThe Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S.\\ndollars using exchange rates in effect\\nat the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate\\nthose in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency\\ntranslation included in\\nAOCI in shareholders\\x92 equity. The Company\\x92s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency\\nremeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and

maturities for strategic reasons\\nincluding, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The maturities of the\\nCompany\\x92s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.\\n\\nAs of September 26, 2015, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities\\ninvestment portfolio to be temporary in\\nnature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests\\nin highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one\\nissuer. The policy\\ngenerally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk\\nof principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When\\nevaluating an investment\\nfor other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair\\nvalue has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in\\nmarket interest rates\\nand the Company\\x92s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment\\nbefore recovery of the investment\\x92s cost basis.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\n\\nThe Company may use\\nderivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future\\ncash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities.\\nHowever, the Company\\nmay choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting\\nconsiderations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the\\nhedges will offset more than\\na portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.\\n\\nTo help protect gross margins from\\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\\x92s subsidiaries whose functional currency is\\nthe U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional\\ncurrency is not\\nthe U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not\\ndenominated in the subsidiaries\\x92 functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option\\ncontracts or other\\ninstruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company typically\\nhedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases,\\ntypically for up to 12\\nmonths.\\n\\nTo help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\\nthe Company may enter\\ninto foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these\\ninvestments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative\\nfinancial instruments, such\\nas its foreign currency-denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\\nsubsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 50\\n\\nThe Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign\\ncurrency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in\\nnon-functional currencies.\\n\\nThe\\nCompany may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These\\ninstruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company\\x92s term\\ndebt or investments.\\nThe Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The Company\\x92s hedged interest\\nrate transactions as of September 26, 2015 are expected to be recognized within 10 years.\\n\\nCash Flow Hedges\\n\\nThe effective portions of cash flow hedges\\nare recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with\\ncash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the\\nrelated revenue is\\nrecognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a\\ncomponent of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses\\nassociated with cash flow\\nhedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the\\nrelated income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness\\ntesting of cash flow hedges\\nare recognized in other income/(expense), net.\\n\\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is\\nprobable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a\\nsubsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are\\nreclassified\\nimmediately into other income/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments\\nare reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.\\n\\nNet Investment Hedges\\n\\nThe effective portions of net investment\\nhedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (\\x93OCI\\x94) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The\\nineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in\\nother\\nincome/(expense), net.\\n\\nFair Value Hedges\\n\\nGains and losses\\nrelated to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related\\nto the change in value of the underlying hedged item.\\n\\nNon-Designated Derivatives\\n\\nDerivatives that are not designated\\nas hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which\\nthe derivative relates.\\n\\nThe Company\\nrecords all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

transaction volume\\noutstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company\\x92s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk\\namounts represent the Company\\x92s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are\\noutstanding or\\nunsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current\\ncurrency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company\\x92s exposure to credit loss\\nand market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the\\nnotional and credit risk amounts of the Company\\x92s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses\\nassociated with\\nthe exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon\\nsettlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will\\ndepend on actual market\\nconditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\\n\\nThe Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce\\ncredit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk,\\nthe Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or\\nposted when the net\\nfair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company\\npresents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance\\nSheets. The net cash\\ncollateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was\\n$1.0 billion as of September 26, 2015 and $2.1 billion as of September 27, 2014.\\n\\nUnder master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company\\x92s derivative contracts, the\\nCompany is allowed to net\\nsettle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2015 and\\nSeptember 27, 2014, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\\x92s derivative\\ncontracts,\\nincluding the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of\\n$2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $78 million and $549\\nmillion, respectively.\\n\\nAccounts Receivable\\n\\nTrade Receivables\\n\\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\\nwholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers,\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not\\nrequire collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit\\ncredit risk. In\\naddition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for\\ncertain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\\nfinancing\\narrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company\\ngenerally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\\n\\nAs of September 26, 2015, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,\\nwhich accounted for 12%. As of\\nSeptember 27, 2014, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of\\nwhich accounted for 16% and the other 13%. The Company\\x92s cellular network carriers accounted for 71% and 72% of\\ntrade\\nreceivables as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively.\\n\\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\\n\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of\\ncomponents to these vendors who manufacture\\nsub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from\\nsuppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Company\\x92s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total\\nvendor non-trade\\nreceivables as of September 26, 2015 and three of the Company\\x92s vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14% of total\\nvendor non-trade receivables as of September 27, 2014.\\n\\nNote 3 \\x96 Consolidated Financial Statement Details\\n\\nThe following tables show the Company\\x92s consolidated financial statement details as of September 26, 2015 and\\nSeptember 27, 2014 (in millions):\\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\\n                                                                              \\n                                                    2015             2014     \\n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n  Land and buildings                          $    6,956       $    4,863     \\n  Machinery, equipment and internal-use           37,038           29,639     \\n  software                                                                    \\n  Leasehold improvements                           5,263            4,513     \\n  Gross property, plant and equipment             49,257           39,015     \\n  Accumulated depreciation and                   (26,786  )       (18,391  )  \\n  amortization                                                                \\n  Total property, plant and equipment, net    $   22,471       $   20,624     \\n                                                                              \\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 53\\n\\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\\n                                                                 \\n                                              2015         2014  \\n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n  Deferred tax liabilities               $  24,062    $  20,259  \\n  Other non-current liabilities              9,365        4,567  \\n  Total other non-current liabilities    $  33,427    $  24,826  \\n                                                                 \\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\\n\\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):\\n                                                                                  \\n                                           2015           2014           2013     \\n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n  Interest and dividend income         $  2,921       $  1,795       $  1,616     \\n  Interest expense                         (733  )        (384  )        (136  )  \\n  Other expense, net                       (903  )        (431  )        (324  )  \\n  Total other income/(expense), net    $  1,285       $    980       $  1,156     \\n                                                                                  \\nNote 4 \\x96 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\n\\nOn July 31, 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming\\nmusic service,\\nand Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes Beats headphones, speakers and audio software (collectively, \\x93Beats\\x94).

The foreign currency transaction gain or\\nloss on the Japanese yen-denominated debt designated as a hedge is recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative\\ntranslation adjustment.\\nAs of September 26, 2015, the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $2.1 billion.\\n\\nFor further discussion\\nregarding the Company\\x92s use of derivative instruments see the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 2,\\n\\x93Financial Instruments.\\x94\\n\\nThe effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if\\napplicable, adjustments related to\\nhedging.

The Company\\x92s share repurchase\\nprogram does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased\\nin privately\\nnegotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\x93Exchange Act\\x94).\\n\\nThe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (\\x93ASRs\\x94) with\\nfinancial institutions. In\\nexchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company\\x92s common stock during the\\npurchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase\\nprice paid\\nper share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-\\naverage price of the Company\\x92s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they\\nare delivered,\\nand the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders\\x92 equity in the Company\\x92s Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets in the periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock\\nin the\\nperiod delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common\\nstock.

2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the \\x932014 Plan\\x94) and terminated the Company\\x92s\\nauthority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the \\x932003 Plan\\x94). The 2014 Plan provides\\nfor broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock\\ngrants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs\\ngranted under the\\n2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of\\nthe Company\\x92s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014\\nPlan reduces the\\nnumber of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy\\ntax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a\\nfactor of two times the\\nnumber of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend\\nequivalent rights (\\x93DERs\\x94), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common\\nstock. DERs are\\nsubject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated\\nand paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares\\nplus the\\nnumber of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding\\nawards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax\\nwithholding obligations with\\nrespect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2015, approximately\\n442.9 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.\\n\\n2003 Employee Stock Plan\\n\\nThe 2003 Plan is a shareholder\\napproved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan\\npermitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights,\\nstock purchase rights\\nand performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the\\ngrant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either\\nannual, semi-annual\\nor quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued\\nemployment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\\x92s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs,\\nother than RSUs\\nheld by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting\\nand other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the\\nunderlying shares vest. In the\\nsecond quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.\\n\\n1997 Director Stock Plan\\n\\nThe 1997 Director Stock Plan (the \\x93Director Plan\\x94) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to\\ngrant awards of RSUs or\\nstock options to the Company\\x92s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a\\nnon-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of\\nshareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock\\noptions and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares\\nof the Company\\x92s\\ncommon stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted\\nunder the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director\\nPlan expires\\nNovember 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same\\nvesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the\\nunderlying shares\\nvest. As of September 26, 2015, approximately 1.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the\\nDirector Plan.\\n\\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Luca Maestri, Daniel\\nRiccio, Philip Schiller and\\nJeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An\\nequity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for\\ndetermining the amounts,\\nprices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company\\x92s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the\\nCompany\\x92s employee and director equity plans.\\n\\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\\n\\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan\\n(the \\x93Purchase Plan\\x94) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the\\nCompany\\x92s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of\\nthe\\nstock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee\\x92s payroll deductions under the\\nPurchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee\\x92s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of\\nstock during\\nany calendar year.

However, the Company maintains directors and\\nofficers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.\\n\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\n\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\x92s business are generally available from multiple sources, a\\nnumber of components are currently\\nobtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other\\nparticipants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the\\nCompany, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage\\nand significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and\\noperating\\nresults.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 64\\n\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products\\nintroduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\x92 yields have matured or\\nmanufacturing\\ncapacity has increased. If the Company\\x92s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or\\nconstrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\\x92s\\nfinancial condition\\nand operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\\x92s business and financial performance\\ncould also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the\\noriginal source,\\nor to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these\\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of\\ncommon components instead of\\ncomponents customized to meet the Company\\x92s requirements.\\n\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however,\\nthere can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at\\nall. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could\\nmaterially\\nadversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nSubstantially all of the Company\\x92s hardware products are manufactured by\\noutsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is\\ncurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these\\noutsourcing partners are the\\nsole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company\\x92s products. Although the Company\\nworks closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company\\x92s operating results could be\\nadversely\\naffected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company\\x92s purchase\\ncommitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.\\n\\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\\n\\nOperating Leases\\n\\nThe Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease\\narrangements. The Company does not\\ncurrently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for\\nterms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the\\nCompany had a total\\nof 463 retail stores. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which\\nare for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company\\x92s total\\nfuture minimum\\nlease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for\\nretail space.\\n\\nRent expense under\\nall operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $794 million, $717 million and $645\\nmillion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases\\nhaving remaining terms\\nin excess of one year as of September 26, 2015, are as follows (in millions):\\n                          \\n  2016          $    772  \\n  2017               774  \\n  2018               744  \\n  2019               715  \\n  2020               674  \\n  Thereafter       2,592  \\n  Total         $  6,271  \\n                          \\nOther Commitments\\n\\nThe Company\\nutilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\\x92s products and to perform final\\nassembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on\\ndemand\\ninformation supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains\\nindividual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry\\npractice, the Company acquires\\ncomponents through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand\\ninformation. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that\\nare outstanding with the respective supplier. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance\\nsheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5 billion.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 65\\n\\nIn addition to the commitments mentioned above, the Company had other off-balance sheet obligations of $7.3\\nbillion as of September 26, 2015 that consisted of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling\\nand manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, R&D,\\ninternet\\nand telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.\\n\\nContingencies\\n\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business\\nand that have not been fully\\nadjudicated, certain of which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \\x93Risk Factors\\x94\\nand in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \\x93Legal Proceedings.\\x94 In the opinion of\\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\\nmaterial loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\\nclaims. However, the\\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an\\noutcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period\\nfor amounts in\\nexcess of management\\x92s expectations, the Company\\x92s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period\\ncould be materially adversely affected.\\n\\nApple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.\\n\\nOn\\nAugust 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung\\nElectronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California,\\nSan Jose Division. On\\nMarch 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately\\n$930 million. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in\\npart,\\nthe decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in\\nthe amount of approximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine supplemental damages and interest,\\nas well as damages\\nowed for products subject to the reversal in part. Because the ruling remains subject to further proceedings, the\\nCompany has not recognized the award in its results of operations.\\n\\nNote 11 \\x96 Segment Information and Geographic Data\\n\\nThe Company reports segment information based on the \\x93management\\x94 approach. The management approach designates the\\ninternal\\nreporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company\\x92s\\nreportable operating segments.\\n\\nThe\\nCompany manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\\x92s reportable operating segments consist\\nof the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North\\nand South\\nAmerica. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater\\nChina segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those\\nAsian countries not\\nincluded in the Company\\x92s other reportable operating segments. Although each reportable operating segment provides\\nsimilar hardware and software products and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the\\nlocation of the\\nCompany\\x92s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The\\naccounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, \\x93Summary of Significant\\nAccounting\\nPolicies.\\x94\\n\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating income.\\nNet sales for\\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\\x92s retail stores\\nlocated in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties,\\nrelated cost of\\nsales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in\\nthe geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other\\nincome and expense and\\ncertain expenses managed outside the reportable operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income\\ninclude various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation\\nexpenses, income\\ntaxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does\\nnot include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\\n\\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 66\\n\\nThe following table shows information by reportable operating segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):\\n                                                                \\n  Americas:                     2015         2014         2013  \\n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n  Net sales                $  93,864    $  80,095    $  77,093  \\n  Operating income         $  31,186    $  26,158    $  24,829  \\n  Europe:                                                       \\n  Net sales                $  50,337    $  44,285    $  40,980  \\n  Operating income         $  16,527    $  14,434    $  12,767  \\n  Greater China:                                                \\n  Net sales                $  58,715    $  31,853    $  27,016  \\n  Operating income         $  23,002    $  11,039    $   8,499  \\n  Japan:                                                        \\n  Net sales                $  15,706    $  15,314    $  13,782  \\n  Operating income         $   7,617    $   6,904    $   6,668  \\n  Rest of Asia Pacific:                                         \\n  Net sales                $  15,093    $  11,248    $  12,039  \\n  Operating income         $   5,518    $   3,674    $   3,762  \\n                                                                \\nA reconciliation of the Company\\x92s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2015,\\n2014 and 2013 is as follows (in millions):\\n                                                                                    \\n                                           2015            2014            2013     \\n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n  Segment operating income            $  83,850       $  62,209       $  56,525     \\n  Research and development expense       (8,067  )       (6,041  )       (4,475  )  \\n  Other corporate expenses, net          (4,553  )       (3,665  )       (3,051  )  \\n  Total operating income              $  71,230       $  52,503       $  48,999     \\n                                                                                    \\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company\\x92s net sales in 2015,\\n2014\\nand 2013.

Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\\nare resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the\\ninherent limitations\\nin all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues\\nand instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\\nperiods are subject\\nto the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that\\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\nManagement\\x92s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\nThe Company\\x92s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\\nreporting (as defined in Rule\\n13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service\\nfeatures (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and\\nreliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\n\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies\\nthat have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware,\\nsoftware, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\\u2019s competitors have\\nbroader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\\nCompany\\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications.

Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,\\nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the\\nCompany\\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-\\nconsuming and disruptive to the Company\\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\\nnotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example,\\ntensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions\\nbeing imposed on the Company\\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by\\ngovernments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect\\nthe Company\\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a\\nnegative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business.\\n\\nMany of the Company\\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\u2019s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In\\naddition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and\\nother cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\\npandemic, and other events beyond the Company\\u2019s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\\nnatural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more\\nintense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver\\nproducts to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and\\nresult in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\u2019s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and\\ndemand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery\\ntime, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company\\nrelies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business\\ninterruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\\nmanufacturers. While the Company\\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\u2019s\\nbusiness, and harm to the Company\\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to\\ntheir impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and\\ndelays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\n\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be\\ninsufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\\n\\nGlobal markets for the Company\\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on\\nthe part of consumers and businesses.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the\\nentire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products\\nand services successfully.\\n                                          Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6                                          \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\u2019s competitors\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\u2019s\\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not\\nconsistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to\\ndevelop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\\u2019s\\nintellectual property, the Company\\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely\\naffected.\\n\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company\\nfaces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier\\nrelationships. In addition, some of the Company\\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and\\na larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost\\nstructures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\u2019s product features and\\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they\\ncurrently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\u2019s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business\\nmodels that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-\\nparty digital content and applications.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\\u2019s ability\\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages.

The success of new product and service introductions\\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\\u2019s\\nability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of\\napplication software for the Company\\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory\\nlevels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at\\nexpected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other\\ndefects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and\\ntransitions of products and services.\\n\\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\n\\nSubstantially all of the Company\\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this\\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes\\nor additions to the Company\\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks\\nand uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these\\narrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\\u2019s direct control over production and\\ndistribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the\\nquality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\\u2019s flexibility to\\nrespond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect\\nexpense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty\\nservice in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.\\nWhile the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code\\nof conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results\\nof operations and financial condition.\\n                                          Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7                                          \\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of\\nthe Company\\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the\\nCompany\\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these\\nlocations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-\\nmade disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business,\\nlabor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\\n\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\\nreduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\\nimpacted.\\n\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\n\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources,\\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global\\nsemiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected\\nthe Company\\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms\\nor at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply\\nof many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\\nsimilar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business\\nfailure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\\u2019s ability to\\nobtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or\\nregional economic conditions on the Company\\u2019s suppliers, described in \\u201c The Company\\u2019s operations and performance\\ndepend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, \\u201d above, can also affect\\nthe Company\\u2019s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\\nshortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\u2019 yields have matured or\\ntheir manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,\\nor at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\u2019s requirements. When the\\nCompany\\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an\\noutsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\\u2019s business, results of\\noperations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\\u2019s business and\\nfinancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain\\nsufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\\u2019s reputation.\\n\\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\\nproducts and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.\\nComponent defects could make the Company\\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage\\nand personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\\u2019s products are introduced into specialized\\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company\\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time\\nto time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\\u2019s services have\\nnot performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be\\nable to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so\\ncan result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\\u2019s products and services. In\\naddition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications,\\nwrite-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other\\nexpenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the\\nexperience for users of the Company\\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\\u2019s reputation, loss\\nof competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product\\nand service introductions and lost sales.\\n                                          Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8                                          \\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\\n\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation\\nfee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital\\nassets held at its suppliers\\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a\\nwrite-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the\\nCompany believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are\\ncurrently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\\nother charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company\\ncompetes.\\n\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing\\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and\\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\\n\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in\\nwhich the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid\\nrate of issuance of new patents, the Company\\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing\\ncertain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,\\nthe Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially\\nreasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\\n\\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\\u2019s products. If third-party software\\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\\u2019s products, customers may choose not\\nto buy the Company\\u2019s products.\\n\\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in\\npart on the developers\\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading\\nsuch software and services for the Company\\u2019s products compared to competitors\\u2019 platforms, such as Android for\\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the\\nanticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing\\nsuch applications and services.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\\u2019s products and more inclined to devote\\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\\u2019 products with larger market share. When\\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the\\nCompany\\u2019s devices can suffer.\\n\\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\\nfor its products. The Company\\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail\\nto take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can\\nresult in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\\u2019s products.\\n                                          Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9                                          \\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission\\nfrom sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to\\ntime, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market\\nconditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the\\nfuture, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (\\u201cEU\\u201d)\\nDigital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to\\nlitigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\\u2019s business\\npractices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with\\nconsumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what\\nthe Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App\\nStore, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding\\nalternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns\\non those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or\\nif it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition could be materially adversely affected.\\n\\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\\u2019s customers, or to make such content\\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\u2019s business, results\\nof operations and financial condition.\\n\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the\\nright to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content\\ninto the Company\\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for\\nrelatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the\\nCompany to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\\nto limit the Company\\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to\\noffer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\\n\\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\\u2019s customers.\\n\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\\nsecurity solutions.

Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both\\nfrequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\\u2019s ability to\\nidentify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can\\nescalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\\n\\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\\nprocesses.\\n\\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through\\nthe use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be\\nsufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently\\ninduce the Company\\u2019s or its vendors\\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive\\ninformation, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\\u2019s or its vendors\\u2019 systems and\\nservices. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like\\nmultifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under\\nsuspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede\\ncustomer access to the Company\\u2019s products and services.\\n\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11                                          \\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\\u2019s ongoing business, present risks\\nnot originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\n\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated\\nwith operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to\\nadditional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the\\nimposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\\nlimit the Company\\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction.

In\\naddition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims,\\nlegal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\n\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For\\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often\\nenter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property\\nrights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well\\nas internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and\\nsubstantial damages.\\n\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government\\ninvestigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\u2019s operations. In recognition of these\\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such\\nchallenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\\nnot occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company\\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and\\nrequire the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\\u2019s ability to offer certain products and\\nservices.\\n\\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \\u201cLegal Proceedings\\u201d and in Part II, Item\\n8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, \\u201cCommitments, Contingencies and\\nSupply Concentrations\\u201d under the heading \\u201cContingencies,\\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a\\nreasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\n\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\\u2019s\\nexpectations, the Company\\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be\\nmaterially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled\\nmonetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the\\nCompany, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business\\npractices and limit the Company\\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12                                          \\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\\u2019s business.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and\\ne-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\\ndigital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile\\ncommunications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and\\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash\\nrepatriation restrictions; anti\\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health\\nand safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\\n\\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\\nadversely affect the Company\\u2019s business by increasing the Company\\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\\u2019s ability to offer\\na product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\\u2019s products and services,\\nimpacting customer demand for the Company\\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\\u2019s supply\\nchain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and\\nregulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\\u2019s products and\\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has\\nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there\\ncan be no assurance the Company\\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or\\nthe Company\\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business may be announced with\\nlittle or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its\\nproducts. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in\\npreventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or\\nprohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\n\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations\\nexpose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the\\nCompany\\u2019s business.\\n\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse\\ngas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes\\nstatements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its\\nwebsite, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\\nconsiderations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires\\ninvestments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\\u2019s control. The\\nCompany cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and\\ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or\\nperceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements,\\ncomply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet\\nevolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against\\nthe Company and materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.\\n\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions\\nand penalties.\\n\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to\\nlitigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make\\nfurther business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store,\\nsuch as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in\\nother jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store\\nregarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers\\nfor access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what\\nextent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing\\nmechanisms.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13                                          \\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which\\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a\\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example,\\nthe Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and\\nconditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to\\nsignificant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject\\nto litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\\u2019s business practices, and may\\nin the future result in further changes.\\n\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely\\naffect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns\\nrevenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company\\u2019s platforms\\nand applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal\\nproceedings.\\n\\nThere can be no assurance the Company\\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\\nChanges to the Company\\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\\nlegal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\\u2019s products for privacy and security and\\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to\\nthe Company\\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\\nservices, and lost sales.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\\nobligations regarding data protection.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection,\\nuse, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not\\nonly to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its\\ninternational subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are\\nconsidering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may\\nbe inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the\\nCompany to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its\\nbusiness practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\n\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure\\nby the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data\\nprotection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental\\nentities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and\\nsignificant legal liability.\\n\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal\\ninformation, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under\\napplicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject\\nto additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by\\ngovernmental authorities regarding the Company\\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to\\nadequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not\\npermitted by law or under the Company\\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be\\nsubject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and\\ncan also incur significant fees or fines.\\n\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if\\ncardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses\\nand can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security\\nstandards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the\\nability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14                                          \\n                                                                                                                   \\n   Financial Risks                                                                                                 \\n                                                                                                                   \\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\\nexample, the gross margins on the Company\\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\\nCompany\\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for\\ncertain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the\\ncost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\\nCompany\\u2019s services; the Company\\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the\\nmix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that\\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign\\nexchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services,\\nincluding new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially\\nadverse impact on the Company\\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its\\nfiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can\\nsignificantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant\\nportion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact\\nquarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated\\ndemand for the Company\\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information\\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\\u2019s logistics, components supply,\\nor manufacturing partners.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\\nrelative to local currencies.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\\u2013U.S. dollar\\u2013denominated sales,\\ncost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\u2019s products in foreign countries and on\\nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could\\nin the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\n\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\\nCompany\\u2019s foreign currency\\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\u2019s strengthening, which\\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\\u2013denominated\\nsales.\\n\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\\nCompany\\u2019s foreign currency\\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing\\nor incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those\\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\n\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to\\noffset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange\\nrates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\\n\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial\\nresults, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other\\nfactors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may\\nfluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash\\nequivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and\\ncould have a material adverse impact on the Company\\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15                                          \\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\\nconditions worsen.\\n\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers,\\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-\\nsized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\u2019s\\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company\\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade\\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The\\nCompany also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing\\npartners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition,\\nthe Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory\\ncomponents. As of September 30, 2023, the Company\\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-\\nterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the\\nCompany has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables,\\nas well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk\\nand avoid losses.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore,\\nwhere a number of the Company\\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and\\ntax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant\\nchange. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for\\nmodernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\u2019s\\neffective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\\nchanges in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax\\nlaws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be\\nsubject to differing interpretations.\\n\\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal\\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\\nan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There\\ncan be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase,\\nor if the ultimate determination of the Company\\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously\\naccrued, the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely\\naffected.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  General Risks                                                                                                    \\n                                                                                                                   \\nThe price of the Company\\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the\\nfuture. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\\nunrelated to these companies\\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\\u2019s price at a given point in time.

On September 10, 2021, the District\\nCourt ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\\u2019s claim. The\\nDistrict Court found that certain provisions of the Company\\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\\u2019s\\nunfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in\\ntheir apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing.

On April 24, 2023, the U.S.\\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \\u201cCircuit Court\\u201d) affirmed the District Court\\u2019s ruling. On June 7, 2023,\\nthe Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30,\\n2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\\u2019s motion to stay\\nenforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In its complaint, Masimo sought a\\npermanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include\\nblood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the \\u201cOrder\\u201d)\\nprohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing\\nfunctionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of\\nthe administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to\\nappeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\\n\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\n\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\\nin the ordinary course of business.

Although management believes the Company\\u2019s reserves are\\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that\\nwhich is reflected in the Company\\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances,\\nsuch as the closing of a tax examination.

Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S.\\ndollar, will negatively affect the Company\\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations\\nin exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect\\nagainst foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local\\ncurrency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign\\ncurrency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\n\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\\u201cVAR\\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the\\npotential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the\\nmaximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\u2019s foreign currency derivative\\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95%\\nconfidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and\\nSeptember 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company\\u2019s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were\\nexcluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\\u2019s foreign currency\\nderivatives.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26                                          \\n\\u256d\\u2500 \\u2022 \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u256e\\n\\u2502                                                                                                                 \\u2502\\n\\u2502  Item 8.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to\\npayment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its\\ncustomers. For most of the Company\\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the\\nCompany\\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of\\nservices, as applicable.\\n\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company\\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\\n\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\\nselling prices (\\u201cSSPs\\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices\\nof the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\u2019s process\\nfor estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique\\nfacts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business\\nobjectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\n\\nThe Company has identified up to threeperformance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale\\nof iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial\\nportion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The\\nsecond performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include\\niCloud \\u00ae , Siri \\u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available\\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company\\nallocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because\\nthe Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based\\non the Company\\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated\\nto the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\n\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered\\nservices.\\n\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it\\ncan establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for\\nensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does\\nnot obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all\\nthird-party application\\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it\\nretains.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34                                          \\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):\\n                                                                                \\n                                              2023          2022          2021  \\n \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 \\n  iPhone(1)                             $  200,583    $  205,489    $  191,973  \\n  Mac(1)                                    29,357        40,177        35,190  \\n  iPad(1)                                   28,300        29,292        31,862  \\n  Wearables, Home and Accessories(1)        39,845        41,241        38,367  \\n  Services(2)                               85,200        78,129        68,425  \\n  Total net sales                       $  383,285    $  394,328    $  365,817  \\n                                                                                \\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are\\nbundled in the sales price of the respective product.\\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain\\nproducts.\\nTotal net sales include $ 8.2billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\nSeptember 24, 2022, $ 7.5billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\nSeptember 25, 2021, and $ 6.7billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\nSeptember 26, 2020.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\\nsegment in Note 13, \\u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data\\u201d for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China,\\nwhere iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.1billion and $\\n12.4billion, respectively.

There can be\\nno assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign\\nexchange or interest rates.\\n\\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated\\nStatements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\\n\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\n\\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or\\nother instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions\\nof its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\\n12months.\\n\\nTo protect the Company\\u2019s foreign currency\\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in\\nforeign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company\\ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length\\nof time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\\ndebt\\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 19years.\\n\\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross\\nmargins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency\\ngains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\\ncurrencies.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nTo protect the Company\\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may\\nuse interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative\\nchanges, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The\\nrecovery amount was calculated to be \\u20ac 13.1billion, plus interest of \\u20ac 1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed\\nthe State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \\u201cGeneral Court\\u201d). On\\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission\\nappealed the General Court\\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \\u201cECJ\\u201d) and a hearing was held on May\\n23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to\\nclaim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due\\nrelated to the State Aid Decision.\\n\\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery\\namount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was \\u20ac\\n12.7billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will\\nremain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The Company also competes for various components\\nwith other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories.\\nTherefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\n\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\\nby the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\u2019 yields have matured or their\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\\ncomponents customized to meet the Company\\u2019s requirements.\\n\\nSubstantially all of the Company\\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46                                          \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Note 13 \\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data                                                                \\n                                                                                                                   \\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

A company\\u2019s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\\nthe company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\\nor procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\n\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n                                         Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51                                          \\n\\u256d\\u2500 \\u2022 \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u256e\\n\\u2502                                                                                                                 \\u2502\\n\\u2502  Item 9.

These tools\\nhelp consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home\\nimprovement projects. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online\\nand picking up in-store, curbside pick-up, same-day delivery through our gig network, and shipment to their homes\\nor businesses. Further, we also offer digital inspiration, design, and project management tools across our\\ndestination home improvement categories.\\n\\nOn-Site\\n\\nWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and\\nservices for their projects. Our Pro sales managers meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job\\nsite and leverage nearby stores and our distribution network to ensure we meet customer needs for products and\\nresources. In addition, our In-Home Sales program is available in the majority of our stores to discuss various\\nexterior projects such as windows, doors, and fencing, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home\\nconsultative sales approach.\\n     \\n  2  \\n     \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nContact Centers\\n\\nLowe\\u2019s operates contact centers in a virtual workplace.

We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Appliances, Seasonal &\\nOutdoor Living, Lumber, Lawn & Garden, Kitchens & Bath, Hardware, Building Materials, Millwork, Paint, Rough\\nPlumbing, Tools, Electrical, Flooring, and D\\u00e9cor. A typical Lowe\\u2019s-branded home improvement store stocks\\napproximately 40,000 items, with additional items available through our online selling channels. Our product\\nassortments offered in-store strive to meet the needs of the local market. See Note 1 6 of the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 , \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\\u201d, of this\\nAnnual Report for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years.\\n\\nWe are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of\\nhigh-value private brands. In fiscal 2023, Klein Tools \\u00ae returned to Lowe\\u2019s, expanding our hand tools, storage,\\nsafety, and electrical product offerings both in-store and online. This addition, along with other recognized\\nnational brands added to our assortment during the fiscal year, position us to better serve our customers with the\\nproducts they need. In addition, we are dedicated to selling products sourced in a socially responsible, efficient,\\nand cost-effective manner.\\n\\nSupply Chain\\n\\nWe source our products from vendors worldwide and believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available\\nfor virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings\\nfor customers and improve our gross margin.\\n\\nTo efficiently replenish our stores and meet our customers\\u2019 expectations for fast fulfillment and delivery, we own\\nand operate more than 120 supply chain facilities in our network. These facilities include regional distribution\\ncenters (RDCs), flatbed distribution centers (FDCs), import distribution centers (IDCs), bulk distribution centers\\n(BDCs), cross-dock terminals (XDTs), and Fulfillment Centers (FCs). Fulfillment centers, which along with many of\\nour stores, ship product directly to our customers. In addition, we are establishing a Pro fulfillment network\\nwhich will leverage a combination of our existing supply chain as well as new facilities. Each one of these\\ndistribution nodes plays a critical role in our Total Home strategy and collectively enable our products to get to\\ntheir destination as efficiently as possible.\\n\\nThe FDCs distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber,\\nboards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. On average, each RDC and FDC serves\\napproximately 115 stores. Our Pro fulfillment network stocks deeper quantities of our top Pro assortments and has\\nexpanded capabilities to handle large orders on multiple flat beds. Our IDCs were expanded to create more capacity\\nto hold import product at the coast, which improves our network\\u2019s agility to move inventory where and when it is\\nneeded. Our BDCs handle appliances and other big and bulky product, and our XDTs fulfill final mile box truck\\ndeliveries of these products.\\n\\nOur supply chain supports every pillar of our Total Home strategy, and as such, we continue to invest and transform\\nour network to unlock our omnichannel capabilities while keeping our organization\\u2019s sustainability goals top of\\nmind. As part of the continued rollout of our market-based delivery model, we expanded to additional geographic\\nareas and enhanced our distribution capacity for big and bulky product. As of fiscal year 2023, we have 16\\ngeographic areas converted to our market-based delivery model.\\n\\nWe have also been focused on improving the speed of our delivery capabilities for our customers. As of fiscal year\\n2023, most parcel-eligible items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard\\nshipping rates. Also, the nationwide expansion of our gig networks provides same-day delivery of certain products\\nfrom our stores. Customer needs and buying patterns are constantly changing, and our supply chain will continue to\\nevolve to meet their needs. We are building an omnichannel supply chain that operates with greater network\\ncapacity, better flow management and optimization.\\n     \\n  3  \\n     \\nTable of Content s\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Our Services                                                                                                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\nInstalled Sales\\n\\nWe offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Flooring,\\nKitchens & Bath, Millwork, Appliances, and Lumber accounting for the majority of installed sales.

We\\nencourage suppliers to report their emissions to CDP, giving suppliers more insight into how they generate\\nemissions, which is the first step toward helping them reduce upstream emissions. This collaboration can help\\nsuppliers increase their operational efficiency and reduce their emissions through the use of renewable energy and\\nlow-carbon innovations. When our suppliers mitigate their impacts on the climate, Lowe\\u2019s own scope 3 emissions can\\nbe reduced.\\n\\nProcuring renewable energy is another lever to reduce our emissions footprint. Our first renewable power purchase\\nagreement, the Mesquite Star wind farm in Texas, went live in fiscal 2020 and is now in its fourth year of\\noperation. As we strive to establish a pipeline of other offsite renewable projects, several projects are planned\\nto become active over the next few years. Lowe\\u2019s is a member of the Clean Energy Buyers Association to evaluate and\\nexplore new opportunities and technologies across renewable energy markets (e.g., community solar, power purchase\\nagreements), as well as implementing on-site solar generation in multiple states. In fiscal 2023, we announced\\nplans to install rooftop solar panels at 174 store and distribution center locations nationwide, including more\\nthan 50 sites currently in operation. Once each site is completed, the solar panels will provide approximately 90%\\nof the energy usage at each location.\\n\\nWe are dedicated to promoting sustainable practices in the transportation industry, and we collaborate with the\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\\u2019s (EPA\\u2019s) SmartWay program to reduce transportation emissions by managing and\\nreducing fuel usage through incentives for freight contractors to improve efficiency. We are an EPA SmartWay\\nprogram partner and aim for 100% SmartWay certification for our transportation providers. This program provides\\naccess to comprehensive data and oversight of scope 3 emissions associated with our U.S. transportation footprint.\\n\\nWaste\\n\\nWe partner with suppliers to improve recycling and waste diversion, develop regional management processes, measure\\nwaste streams, and conduct waste audits. At a local level, store waste, including cardboard, broken appliances, and\\nwood pallets, is recycled through national and regional partners, and we provide in-store recycling and reuse\\ncenters for our customers to bring in plastic planter pots, compact fluorescent lamp bulbs, plastic bags, and\\nrechargeable batteries. In our third year collaborating with How2Recycle, we continue to educate customers and\\nencourage proper recycling of our product packaging. As technology and innovative practices improve, we will\\ncontinue to explore opportunities to participate in the circular economy.\\n\\nWater\\n\\nWhile our water consumption is modest compared with other industries, we continue to focus on reducing water\\nconsumption within our operations. We use smart irrigation controllers for efficient watering at most stores and\\nhave been exploring other water-efficient measures to increase water savings in our stores and garden centers.\\nAdditionally, we use leak detection technology to catch leaks as they occur to prevent unnecessary water use. We\\nalso have protocols in place to manage the disposal of chemicals to prevent release into waterways of the\\ncommunities we serve.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Corporate Responsibility Reporting                                                                               \\n                                                                                                                   \\nLowe\\u2019s participates in the CDP\\u2019s climate change, forests, and water security questionnaires to benchmark and\\nquantify our environmental practices and provide transparency on our progress. Lowe\\u2019s continues to externally\\nverify our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and water usage data to increase confidence in our reporting. Additionally,\\nour annual Corporate Responsibility Report is guided by the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board, the Global\\nReporting Initiative, and the U.N.

All forward-looking statements about our future results\\nof operations or other matters made by us in this Annual Report, in our Annual Report to Lowe\\u2019s Shareholders, and\\nin our subsequently filed reports to the SEC, as well as in our press releases and other public communications, are\\nqualified by the risks described below.\\n\\nYou should read these risk factors in conjunction with \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\\nand Results of Operations\\u201d in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 . There\\nalso may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this Annual Report generally\\nbecause we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially\\nfrom our expectations. In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should\\ncarefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our\\nother filings with the SEC.\\n\\nStrategic, Competitive, Operational, and Reputational Risks\\n\\nWe may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing\\nshopping habits, demands, and demographics of our customers.\\n\\nThe home improvement retail environment, like the retail environment generally, is rapidly evolving, and adapting\\nour business concept to respond to our customers\\u2019 changing shopping habits and demands and their changing\\ndemographics is critical to our future success. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to\\nthe economic, social, style, and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our\\nmerchandise categories and service offerings, as well as consumer spending. Customers\\u2019 expectations about how they\\nwish to research, purchase, and receive products and services have also evolved. It is difficult to predict the mix\\nof products and services that our customers will demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience,\\nour ability to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local tastes within each customer\\ngroup is important to our ability to effectively meet customer expectations. Customers also have evolving\\npreferences and expectations related to the sustainability of our products and operations. If we do not\\nsuccessfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a\\ncustomer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.\\n\\nFailure to identify such trends, adapt our business concept, implement an increasingly localized merchandising\\nassortment, and implement related strategic initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with\\nour customers, the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell, the rate of growth of our\\nbusiness, our market share, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe may not be able to realize the intended benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on providing an\\nomnichannel shopping experience to our customers if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on\\nthem.\\n\\nOur interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they use computers, tablets, mobile\\nphones, and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary\\nabout all aspects of our business. Omnichannel and digital retail is quickly evolving, and we must anticipate and\\nmeet our customers\\u2019 expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. Our\\ncustomer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed, and provide a consistent\\ncustomer experience. We also need to collect, use, and share relevant customer data to effectively meet customer\\nexpectations of a more personalized experience. Our ability to collect, use, and share such data is subject to a\\nnumber of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security,\\nas well as the change of third-party policies restricting data collection, use, and sharing.\\n\\nThe success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers\\u2019 changing shopping habits\\nand demands and changing demographics have required us to, and will continue to require us to, deliver large,\\ncomplex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing. These\\ninitiatives have required, and will continue to require, new competencies in many positions, and our management,\\nassociates, and contractors have had to and will need to continue to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities.\\nTo the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of\\nour strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we\\ninvest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being\\n     \\n  8  \\n     \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nwritten down or written off. In addition, to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology\\ninvestments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled\\nprofessionals, including technology professionals. The market for these professionals is increasingly competitive.\\nOur results of operations, financial condition, or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail\\nto provide a consistent experience for our customers, regardless of sales channel, if our technology systems do not\\nmeet our customers\\u2019 expectations, if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by\\nour competitors, or if we are unable to attract, retain, and manage the talent succession of additional personnel\\nat various levels of the Company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic\\ninitiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly\\nchanging retail environment.\\n\\nWe have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our strategic\\ninitiatives effectively, or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer\\nneeds, resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\\n\\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and\\nsmall, direct and indirect competitors. The principal competitive factors in our industry include location of\\nstores, product assortment, product pricing, in-stock levels, customer service, and the evolution of technology and\\ncustomer expectations. We face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product\\nor service offering. Customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine real-time product\\navailability and price using digital tools. We will be at a competitive disadvantage if, over time, our competitors\\nare more effective than us in their utilization and integration of rapidly evolving technologies, including\\nartificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Further, online and omnichannel retailers continue to\\nfocus on delivery services, as customers are increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times, including\\nsame-day and next-day fulfillment, low-price or free shipping, and convenient pick-up options, and we must make\\ninvestments to keep up with our customers\\u2019 evolving shopping preferences. Our ability to be competitive on delivery\\ntimes, delivery costs, and delivery options depends on many factors, including successful implementation and the\\ncontinued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation, including our market-based\\ndelivery model, and our relationships with third parties providing delivery services. Our failure to respond\\neffectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could\\naffect our financial performance. Moreover, changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our\\ncompetitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation activities, may impact our results.\\n\\nIf we fail to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates or corporate support staff with the capabilities\\nof delivering on strategic objectives, our labor costs and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\\n\\nOur customers expect our associates to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home\\nimprovement services we provide. We compete with other retailers for many of our associates, and we are\\nexperiencing a competitive labor market with low unemployment. Increasingly, our sales associates must have\\nexpanded skill sets. It is important that we attract and retain a diverse workforce that can deliver relevant,\\nculturally competent, and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers.\\nAdditionally, in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers and related strategic\\nobjectives, we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff, which are broadly\\nsought after by our competitors. Further, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including\\nmanagement transitions within the Company's senior leadership, are critical to our business success. The loss of\\nkey executive or senior officers or our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management personnel\\ncould impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to hire, train, manage, and retain\\nqualified associates, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations\\ncould be negatively affected.\\n\\nOur ability to meet our labor needs, particularly in a competitive labor market, while controlling our costs is\\nsubject to a variety of external factors, including wage rates, the availability of and competition for talent,\\nhealth care and other benefit costs, our brand image and reputation, changing demographics and the adoption of new\\nor revised legislation or regulations governing immigration, employment, labor relations, minimum wage, health care\\nbenefits and family and medical leave. Wages are increasing across the United States, and due to competition among\\npotential employers, we are subject to upward pressure on associate wages and employer-provided benefits, which in\\nturn increases labor costs. Additionally, many associates are in entry-level or part-time roles with historically\\nhigher turnover rates, which leads to increased training and retention costs. Further, there is increased labor\\norganizing activity in the United States. We are subject to labor organizing efforts from time to time, and if we\\nbecome subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could affect how we operate our business. Our\\nresponse to any organizing efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation. In addition\\nto our United States operations, we have support offices in India and China, and any extended disruption of our\\noperations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adversely affect our\\nbusiness and results of operations.\\n     \\n  9  \\n     \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nPositively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success, and, if\\nour public image and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers,\\nvendors, associates, and shareholders, and consequently, our business and results of operations.\\n\\nOur public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe\\u2019s, our vendors want to do\\nbusiness with Lowe\\u2019s, and our associates want to work for Lowe\\u2019s. We must continue to manage, preserve, and grow\\nLowe\\u2019s public image and reputation. Lowe\\u2019s actual or perceived position or lack of position on social,\\nenvironmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about\\nthose matters, could harm our reputation. In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social goals,\\nand consumer and shareholder concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of\\nreputational risk. Vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can\\nerode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image,\\nundermine our customers\\u2019 confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with\\ncurrent and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our\\nassociates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. The significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years\\nhas compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents.\\n\\nAdditionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights,\\npatents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. We may not be\\nable to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third-party uses of our intellectual property or\\ndilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own.\\nIf we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely\\naffected.\\n\\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers,\\nexpose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\\n\\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Lowe\\u2019s and our brand\\nimage. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers\\u2019 expectations\\nregarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial\\nand reputational risks. As a result, Lowe\\u2019s reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services,\\nincluding both national and Lowe\\u2019s private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty. Additionally, we and\\nour customers have expectations on responsible sourcing and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Under\\nour Vendor Code of Conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance,\\nincluding health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and\\nforced labor. Where appropriate, we request that our vendors provide additional documentation proving their\\ncompliance in these areas. If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less\\nfamiliarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. Actual, potential, or perceived product safety\\nconcerns or vendor non-compliance exposes us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and could,\\nand in certain instances in the past has, resulted in costly product recalls, the inability to sell certain\\nproducts due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions, and\\nother liabilities.\\n\\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to maintain our store base and maintain appropriate levels of\\ninventory and failure to do so may affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\\n\\nWe have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the\\nshopping experience that our customers desire. Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the\\nconvenience or relevant shopping experience our customers expect. It is important that we maintain appropriate\\nlevels of inventory in our stores and supply chain facilities and respond to changing customer demands. We must\\nalso maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or\\ntheft of our inventory (known as \\u201cshrink\\u201d). Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time,\\nincluding as a result of organized retail crime, can require operational changes that may increase costs and\\nadversely impact customer and associate experience.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks                                                                               \\n                                                                                                                   \\nDisruptions in our supply chain and our fulfillment network for our products due to various factors including, but\\nnot limited to, global health crises, geopolitical conflicts, trade policy changes, and additional tariffs, have\\naffected and may continue to affect our business and results of operations.\\n\\nWe source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and\\nefficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather\\nconditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global\\nsupply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and\\ninternational supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past due to\\ndifficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\\n      \\n  10  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nWe source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers, with China being the dominant import source.\\nTax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other\\ncountries, especially China, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which\\nrepresents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or\\ntrade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect\\nour business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other\\ncountries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import\\ntariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the\\nfuture. The degree of our exposure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and\\ntiming of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by\\nmerchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these\\npotential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\\n\\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest\\nin source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including\\nfuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of\\npandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays\\nand disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a\\nmajor source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds,\\ndetentions, and exclusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and\\ncould negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain\\nor increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion\\nand delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters, which were\\nfurther exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our\\nfulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment\\nnetwork does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in\\ninventory, increased delivery costs or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased\\ncustomer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\\n\\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term,\\nand these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\\n\\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing\\ncustomer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and\\noptimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them\\nin the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the\\nvolume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and\\nfinancial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design,\\nand interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with\\nimplementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility\\nlocations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing third-party service providers, could disrupt or\\nreduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our\\nsupply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize\\nanticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and\\nour financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\\n\\nOur inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of both\\nnational brand and private branded products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\\n\\nWe form strategic relationships, some of which are exclusive, with selected suppliers to market and develop\\nproducts under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names. We also have relationships with certain\\nsuppliers to enable us to sell private branded products which differentiate us from other retailers. The inability\\nto effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact\\nour business operations and financial results.\\n\\nFailure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and\\nnegatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell. We also rely upon\\nmany independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects\\nof our business. Many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to\\nsupport our business concept and our strategies. If these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or\\nare unable to perform as expected, or if we\\n      \\n  11  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nfail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly, our business could be adversely affected, at\\nleast temporarily, until we are able to replace them.\\n\\nFailures relating to our third-party installer program or by our third-party installers have resulted in and could\\nresult in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations.\\n\\nWe contract with third-party installers to provide installation services to our customers, and, as the general\\ncontractor, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, including\\ncertain licensing and permitting requirements, and those relating to the quality and performance of our third-party\\ninstallers. We have faced investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with\\napplicable laws and regulations, including an investigation with respect to whether we are in compliance with\\napplicable recordkeeping requirements and lead-safe practices. Any adverse result following such investigations\\ncould negatively affect our operations. In addition, failures by us or our third-party installers to effectively\\nmanage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services have, from time to time, resulted\\nin, and in the future could result in lost sales, fines, and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, and may\\nresult in the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could negatively affect our business.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Technology and Cybersecurity Risks                                                                               \\n                                                                                                                   \\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or the information systems of\\nthird-party vendors are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade, and expand those\\nsystems.\\n\\nOur efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in, maintaining, and making\\nongoing improvements of our existing information systems that support operations, such as sales, inventory\\nreplenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and\\nfulfillment. We also engage third-party vendors for a variety of reasons, including for digital storage technology\\nand content delivery. Such vendors may have access to information about our customers, associates, or vendors. Our\\nsystems and the systems of third-party vendors are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic\\nevents, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks, and telecommunications failures, or other vulnerabilities and\\nirregularities, and as a result we may incur significant expense, data loss, as well as an erosion of customer\\nconfidence.\\n\\nAdditionally, we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption. In particular, the\\nCompany is undergoing a multi-year technology transformation which includes updating and modernizing our\\nmerchandise selling system, as well as certain accounting and finance systems. We may not be able to achieve the\\nanticipated benefits of these investments and may experience operational challenges such as delays or errors in\\nimplementation, security failures such as loss or corruption of data, reputational harm, increased costs and other\\nsignificant disruptions. Our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems are\\nseriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade, and expand those systems.\\n\\nThe failure of customer-facing technology systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering\\npositive customer experiences.\\n\\nAccess to the Internet from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile communication devices has empowered\\nour customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them. Our websites, primarily Lowes.com, are a\\nsales channel for our products, and are also a method of making product, project, and other relevant information\\navailable to our customers that impacts our in-store sales. Additionally, we have other affiliated websites and\\nmobile apps through which we seek to inspire, inform, cross-sell, establish online communities among, and otherwise\\ninteract with our customers, including through online visualization and configuration tools. Performance issues\\nwith these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service,\\nransomware, or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan\\nthat can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement\\nbusiness and negatively affect our customers\\u2019 perceptions of Lowe\\u2019s as a reliable online vendor and source of\\ninformation about home improvement products and services.\\n\\nOur business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by\\ncybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, associate, vendor, or Company information or to comply\\nwith evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets, and such information.\\n\\nCyber-attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission\\ncritical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to\\nunauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a\\nnumber of major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-\\nattack threat and improved data protection methods.\\n      \\n  12  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nAs with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about\\nour customers, associates, and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and\\npayment card information. Additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as\\nauthentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply\\nchain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party\\nservice providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned.\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, we and our third-party service providers have in the past and will likely\\ncontinue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents, and certain of our third-party service providers have\\nbeen subject to disruption due to ransomware and other cyber-attacks. Although, we do not believe such\\ncybersecurity threats or incidents have had a material impact on us to date, there is no guarantee that a future\\ncybersecurity threat or incident will be detected and remediated to not have a material adverse impact on our\\nbusiness strategy, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition. It can be difficult to preempt or\\ndetect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks, and we and our third-party service providers may not be able to\\nadequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access\\nto, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data. The increased levels of remote\\naccess to our information systems and the continued use of remote work infrastructure has further increased the\\npossible attack surfaces, and we are exposed to increased risk to the security of our information systems or the\\ninformation systems of third-party vendors and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.\\n\\nA ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that\\nsupport Lowe\\u2019s operations. Our information security or our service providers\\u2019 information security may also be\\ncompromised because of human errors or acts, including by associates, or system errors. Our systems and our service\\nproviders\\u2019 systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure\\noutages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of\\nmalicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware. In the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any\\nreason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such\\nbreach or damage is being remedied. Should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss, or unavailability\\nof data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive existing and\\npotential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including\\npossible litigation and punitive damages. A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our\\ninformation systems or our third-party service providers\\u2019 information systems would also materially increase the\\ncosts we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the\\naftermath of such a breach. We maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage although such insurance may be\\ninsufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur or may not cover certain cyber incidents. Additionally, the\\nrapid evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies and the implementation of pilot\\nprograms integrating generative artificial intelligence into our internal and customer-facing systems may intensify\\nour cybersecurity risks and create new risks to our business, operations, and financial condition.\\n\\nData privacy and cybersecurity laws are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more\\ncomplex. In order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased\\ncosts and change our business policies and processes in order to adapt to new requirements that are or become\\napplicable to us. As the regulatory environment relating to retailers\\u2019 and other companies\\u2019 obligation to protect\\npersonal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could\\nsubject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions, or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought\\nby private individuals, regulators or states\\u2019 attorney general. Such violation or perceived violation of privacy,\\nincluding improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy\\npractice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, associates, and business partners have in us related to\\ntheir personal information.\\n\\nSee Item 1C of this Form 10-K, \\u201cCybersecurity,\\u201d for more information on our cybersecurity risk management and\\ngovernance.\\n\\nWe are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to\\npotential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\\n\\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private\\nlabel and co-branded credit cards, trade credit, mobile and electronic payments, gift cards, cash, consumer\\ninvoicing and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time. These payment options\\nsubject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association\\noperating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds\\ntransfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal\\nelements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment\\nsystems. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or\\ncompromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks\\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction\\n      \\n  13  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nfees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds\\ntransfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely\\naffected. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which\\nmay increase over time and raise our operating costs. Additionally, we rely on third parties to provide payment\\nprocessing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards,\\npromotional financing, and other forms of electronic payment, and it could disrupt our business if these companies\\nbecome unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. National outages with our third-party credit and debit\\nprocessor have resulted in lost sales and declined transactions after purchases. Future occurrences of such\\nfailures in third party systems are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our operations in unexpected\\nways.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Investment-Related Risks                                                                                         \\n                                                                                                                   \\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous\\nuncertainties and risks.\\nWe regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures,\\ninvestments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these\\ntransactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies, and other various benefits. Our ability to\\ndeliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks,\\nincluding our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully;\\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical\\npersonnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations. Effective internal\\ncontrols are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may\\ncreate complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage.\\nIntegration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting\\nobligations. Additionally, we have recognized material impairments in the past and may do so in the future,\\nincluding in connection with assets we have acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings\\nassociated with any strategic transaction, which have and may in the future materially reduce our earnings. For\\nexample, in fiscal 2022, the Company recorded pre-tax impairment, loss on sale, and other closing costs of $2.5\\nbillion related to the sale of its Canadian retail business, which reduced earnings for fiscal 2022. Our\\nshareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and strategic transactions may also be subject to\\nregulatory uncertainty due to the changing enforcement landscape. We may not realize the anticipated benefits from\\nsuch transactions, we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture, and we\\nmay be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction. Further, we may finance these strategic\\ntransactions by incurring additional debt, which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in\\nthe future.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Legal, Regulatory and Other External Risks                                                                       \\n                                                                                                                   \\nOur sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy. Adverse changes in macroeconomic\\nfactors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and\\ncomparable sales.\\n\\nMany macroeconomic factors may adversely affect our financial performance. These include, but are not limited to,\\nperiods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, age of\\nhousing stock, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the\\nconsequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Lowe\\u2019s and its customers, slower rates of growth\\nin real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its\\nimpacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, the\\nimpact of rising interest rates, consumer debt levels, changes in tax rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics,\\nfluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, geopolitical\\nor armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism. Additionally, in fiscal 2023, we\\ncontinued to operate in an environment with inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. In particular, if\\ncost inflation of merchandise increases beyond our ability to control or respond effectively, we may not be able to\\nadjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer\\ndemand. Sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement\\nprojects. Adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could\\nreduce demand for our products and services.\\n\\nOur business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including natural disasters\\nand changes in climate, as well as other catastrophic events, which could impact our operations.\\n\\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable,\\nor unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a\\nresult of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of\\nterrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic\\nevents can affect consumer spending and confidence and\\n      \\n  14  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nconsumers\\u2019 disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could\\nhave an adverse effect on our financial performance. Natural disasters or catastrophic climate events may increase\\ndemand for certain of our products, and if we are unable to meet such customer demands, our reputation, business,\\nand financial operations could be harmed, particularly if our responses to such events are less adequate than those\\nof our competitors. These types of events can also adversely affect our workforce and prevent associates and\\ncustomers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also disrupt or disable operations of stores,\\nsupport centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the\\navailability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information\\nsystems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with\\ncustomers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather\\nconditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme\\nperiods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable. As a\\nconsequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our\\noperations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our\\nrevenue and profitability.\\n\\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to the long-term effects of global climate change.\\n\\nOur business and operations are subject to climate-related risks. These include both physical risks (such as\\nextreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes),\\nwhich are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires,\\ndroughts, and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the Company\\u2019s operations and facilities are located,\\nand they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience.\\nSuch events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows, and\\nfinancial performance. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may\\nincrease compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect\\nour profitability. In addition, we use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of\\nwhich could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.\\n\\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new\\nfederal, state or local laws and regulations.\\n\\nOur business is subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. In recent years, a\\nnumber of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing\\nlaws and regulations by federal, state, and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations\\nand enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic, or social\\nevents. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations\\ngoverning minimum wage requirements, collective bargaining, the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees,\\nthe distinction between employees and contractors, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, health care, data\\nprivacy and cybersecurity, the sale and pricing of some of our products, transportation, logistics, international\\ntrade, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, taxes, unclaimed property, sustainability, the environment\\nand climate change, including energy costs and consumption, could increase our costs of doing business or impact\\nour operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign\\nCorrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputational and legal risks, including\\ngovernment enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or\\nsettlements, negatively affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, including consumer, commercial, employment, tort and\\nother litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary\\ncourse of our business. Some of these proceedings raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are\\nsubject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries\\nand governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or\\nresolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require\\nsubstantial payments. Furthermore, defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management\\u2019s\\nattention and resources. None of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved, individually or\\ncollectively, are considered material.\\n\\nThe inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, and our\\nsales.\\n\\nPrices of certain commodity products, including lumber, copper, energy, and other raw materials, are historically\\nvolatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand,\\ninflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade\\nrestrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as\\nchanges in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio\\nstrategy, have affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for our products and our sales.\\n      \\n  15  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nTax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\\n\\nWe may be affected by higher rates of federal, state, or local tax imposed as a result of political developments or\\neconomic conditions, which could affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate and future tax liability\\ncould be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes, the results of tax audits and examinations, disallowed\\ntax strategies, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters, all of which\\ncould negatively impact our business. Changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and\\ncounterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nLiquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational, and open capital markets and are dependent on our\\ncredit strength. Our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business, financial\\nperformance, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe rely on cash flows from operations, as well as continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and\\nlong-term basis, as needed, to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, return\\nexcess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and repay debt maturities as they\\nbecome due. Our access to capital markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of such\\ncapital markets and our operating performance. If rating agencies lower or place our credit ratings on a credit\\nwatch, or if we experience a deterioration of certain financial ratios, it could adversely affect our ability to\\naccess the public debt markets and our cost of funds. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings\\nperiodically, and there is no guarantee that our current credit ratings will remain the same. Disruption in the\\nfinancial markets, including as a result of rising interest rates, bank failures or other macroeconomic conditions,\\nor an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet\\ncapital requirements or fund working capital needs.\\n\\u256d\\u2500 \\u2022 \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u256e\\n\\u2502                                                                                                                 \\u2502\\n\\u2502  Item 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments                                                                            \\u2502\\n\\u2502                                                                                                                 \\u2502\\n\\u2570\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u256f\\nNone.\\n\\u256d\\u2500 \\u2022 \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u256e\\n\\u2502                                                                                                                 \\u2502\\n\\u2502  Item 1C - Cybersecurity                                                                                        \\u2502\\n\\u2502                                                                                                                 \\u2502\\n\\u2570\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u256f\\nWe maintain a robust cybersecurity program that we have designed with the goal of identifying, deterring,\\ndetecting, responding to, and managing potential cybersecurity risks and threats.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Risk Management and Strategy                                                                                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\nRisk management is a central part of our cybersecurity program.

The decrease in total sales was driven by\\nthe sale of the Canadian retail business in fiscal 2022, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2022, and a decrease\\nin comparable sales. Prior year sales included $5.0 billion generated by our Canadian retail business, as well as\\napproximately $1.4 billion due to the 53rd week. Comparable sales decreased 4.7% over the same period, driven by a\\n4.6% decline in comparable customer transactions and 0.1% decline in comparable average ticket. Comparable sales\\nchange during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were declines of 4.3% in the first quarter, 1.6% in the\\nsecond quarter, 7.4% in the third quarter, and 6.2% in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nDuring fiscal 2023, we experienced comparable sales increases in two of 14 product categories: Building Materials\\nand Lawn & Garden. Strength in Building Materials reflects strong demand from Pro customers while Lawn & Garden\\nbenefited from seasonal demand in the first half of the year. Our DIY customer categories were impacted by lower\\nDIY discretionary demand, particularly in bigger-ticket items, as consumers continue to navigate the macroeconomic\\nenvironment. Our lowest comparable sales were in Lumber which were pressured by significant commodity deflation.\\n\\nGross Margin \\u2013 Gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2023 leveraged 16 basis points compared to fiscal\\n2022. The gross margin increase for the year was driven by productivity initiatives and lower transportation costs,\\npartially offset by higher costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network.\\n\\nSG&A \\u2013 SG&A expense for fiscal 2023 leveraged 292 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2022.\\nThis was primarily driven by cycling the long-lived asset impairment, loss on sale, and other closing costs\\nassociated with the sale of the Canadian retail business in the prior year, and two favorable legal settlements in\\nthe current year, partially offset by fixed cost deleverage due to lower sales.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization \\u2013 Depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged 17 basis points for fiscal 2023\\nas a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower sales.\\n\\nInterest \\u2013 Net \\u2013 Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\\n                                                                   \\n  (In millions)                                  2023        2022  \\n \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 \\n  Interest expense, net of amount            $  1,459    $  1,137  \\n  capitalized                                                      \\n  Amortization of original issue discount          23          20  \\n  and loan costs                                                   \\n  Interest on tax uncertainties                     1           3  \\n  Interest income                                -101         -37  \\n  Interest \\u2013 net                             $  1,382    $  1,123  \\n                                                                   \\nNet interest expense in fiscal 2023 deleveraged 44 basis points primarily due to incremental interest expense\\nrelated to the issuance of unsecured notes over the past year, partially offset by interest income on our cash\\nequivalents and short-term investments.\\n\\nIncome Tax Provision \\u2013 Our effective income tax rate was 24.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to 28.8% in fiscal 2022.

We base these estimates on historical\\nresults and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates\\nconcerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual\\nresults may differ from these estimates.\\n\\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements included\\nherein. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management\\njudgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Merchandise Inventory                                                                                            \\n                                                                                                                   \\nDescription\\n\\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.\\nThis reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical\\nexperience. During fiscal 2023, our reserve increased approximately $106 million to $245 million as of February 2,\\n2024.\\n\\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories. This reserve is based\\nprimarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories. During fiscal 2023, the inventory shrink\\nreserve decreased approximately $3 million to $425 million as of February 2, 2024.\\n\\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase\\nvolumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors\\u2019 products. Generally, these vendor funds do not\\nrepresent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor\\u2019s\\nproduct. The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are\\nnegotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they\\nare earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that\\nare determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors\\u2019\\nproducts are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\\n\\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\\n\\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term\\nin excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated\\nsales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration\\nin product quality could result in the need for additional reserves. Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink\\nreserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories. We also apply judgment in the\\ndetermination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\\n\\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place. Due to the diversity\\nof the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes\\nthroughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure\\nthe amounts earned are appropriately recorded. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual\\npurchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for\\nincreased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\\n\\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\\n\\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related\\nreserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years.

When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, our asset group\\nis generally at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.\\nCash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.\\n\\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to\\ndetermine when a location\\u2019s assets may not be recoverable. For operating locations, our primary indicator that\\nassets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a twelve-month period for those locations that\\nhave been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing\\noperating results. Management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment,\\nincluding individual locations\\u2019 execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including\\nincursion, which is the opening of either other Lowe\\u2019s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same\\nmarket. We also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely\\nthan not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its\\npreviously estimated useful life.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the assets within\\nthe Canadian retail business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their\\npreviously estimated useful lives and were evaluated for recoverability. Based on the proposed transaction, the\\nCompany reconsidered the appropriate asset grouping of long-lived assets attributable to the Company\\u2019s Canadian\\nlocations given the change in the Company\\u2019s expectations regarding use and disposition of its associated assets.\\nThe Company determined the total Canada retail business (Canada asset group) to be the appropriate asset group for\\nwhich Canadian business assets should be evaluated, as this represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash\\nflows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Changes in asset group\\ndeterminations are accounted for on a prospective basis.\\n\\nA potential impairment has occurred if the fair value of the asset group is less than the asset group\\u2019s carrying\\nvalue. The carrying value of an operating location\\u2019s asset group includes inventory, property, operating and\\nfinance lease right-of-use assets and operating liabilities including accounts payables, accrued compensation, and\\noperating lease liabilities. Financial and non-operating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the\\nasset group. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating\\nlocation, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including\\nsales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and operating expense, as well as\\nasset residual values or lease rates. Operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows.\\nFinancing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized when\\nthe carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\\n\\nThe carrying value of the Canada asset group included substantially all assets and liabilities of the Canadian\\nretail business, including accounts receivable, inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use\\nassets, definite-lived intangible assets, operating liabilities including accounts payable and accrued\\ncompensation, and operating and finance lease liabilities. The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment\\nbalance was excluded from the carrying value of the Canada asset group in evaluating the recoverability of a held\\nand used asset group.\\n\\nWe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires\\ndiscounting projected future cash flows. This involves making assumptions regarding both a location\\u2019s future cash\\nflows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash\\nflows. We discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants\\nwould assign to the cash flows. The selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market\\nfootprint similar in size to ours.\\n\\nWe use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for sale or closure.\\nThis involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining\\ninformation from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated. The information includes\\ncomparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these\\nassets. A market approach of an orderly transaction under current market conditions was used in determining the\\nestimated fair value of the Canada asset group, which was based on the proposed transaction price, inclusive of\\nperformance-based contingent consideration.\\n      \\n  31  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\\n\\nOur impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred,\\nincluding the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed or an asset will be\\notherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Our impairment loss\\ncalculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows, including estimated sales,\\nmargin, and controllable expenses, assumptions about market performance for operating locations, and estimated\\nselling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure. We also apply judgment in estimating asset fair\\nvalues, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income\\napproach.\\n\\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\\n\\nDuring fiscal 2023, long-lived asset impairment was immaterial. During fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $2.1\\nbillion of long-lived asset impairment within selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in the\\nconsolidated statements of earnings, which reflected the full carrying value of the long-lived assets of the Canada\\nasset group. If the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in\\ndetermining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its\\nuseful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses\\ncould vary from our estimated impairment losses. In the event that our estimates vary from actual results, we may\\nrecord additional impairment losses, which could be material to our results of operations.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Self-Insurance                                                                                                   \\n                                                                                                                   \\nDescription\\n\\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers\\u2019 compensation, automobile, general and product\\nliability, extended protection plans, and certain medical and dental claims.

Generally, these vendor funds do not\\nrepresent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the\\nvendor\\u2019s product. Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are\\nrecognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold. Funds that are determined to be\\nreimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors\\u2019 products are recorded as\\nan offset to the related expense. Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs\\nanalyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to\\nensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if\\nactual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that\\nprovide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\\n      \\n  36  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nWe identified the completeness and accuracy of vendor funds as a critical audit matter given the significance of\\nvendor funds to the financial statements and volume of the individual vendor agreements. This required an increased\\nextent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the vendor funds were completely and\\naccurately recorded in accordance with the vendor agreements.\\n\\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\\n\\nOur audit procedures related to whether the vendor funds were completely and accurately recorded in accordance with\\nthe terms of the vendor agreements included the following, among others:\\n\\n\\u2022 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over vendor funds, including management\\u2019s controls\\nover the identification of vendor agreements as well as the accrual and recording of vendor funds as a reduction to\\nthe cost of inventory as they are earned, and as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventory is sold.\\n\\n\\u2022 We selected a sample of vendor funds and recalculated the amount earned using the terms of the vendor agreement,\\nincluding the amount recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory when earned, and the amount recorded as a\\nreduction to cost of sales as the related inventory is sold.\\n\\n\\u2022 We selected a sample of vendor funds and sent confirmations to test the completeness of programs as well as the\\naccuracy of amounts earned and terms of the agreement directly with the vendor.\\n\\n\\u2022 Where confirmation responses from vendors were not received, we completed alternative procedures, such as\\nagreement to underlying contractual arrangements and tested the settlement of the arrangement.\\n\\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\\n\\nCharlotte, North Carolina\\n\\nMarch 25, 2024\\n\\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1962.\\n      \\n  37  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\n\\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Lowe\\u2019s Companies, Inc.\\n\\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lowe\\u2019s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the\\n\\u201cCompany\\u201d) as of February 2, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting\\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\\nthe company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance

2, 2024, FEBRUARY 3, 2023, AND JANUARY 28, 2022\\n\\nNOTE 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nLowe\\u2019s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is the world\\u2019s second-largest home improvement retailer and\\noperated 1,746stores and outlets in the United States as of February 2, 2024. On February 3, 2023, Lowe\\u2019s completed\\nthe sale of its Canadian retail business, which operated 232stores in Canada, as well as serviced 210dealer-owned\\nstores. The Canadian retail business included a number of complementary formats under the banners of RONA, Lowe\\u2019s\\nCanada, R\\u00e9no-D\\u00e9p\\u00f4t, and Dick\\u2019s Lumber. See Note 6 for information on this divestiture.\\n\\nBelow are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.\\nFiscal Year - The Company\\u2019s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2022 contained 53\\nweeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2021 each contained 52 weeks. All references herein for the years 2023, 2022, and\\n2021 represent the fiscal years ended February 2, 2024, February 3, 2023, and January 28, 2022, respectively.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\\nwholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\\nForeign Currency - The functional currencies of the Company\\u2019s international subsidiaries are generally the local\\ncurrencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located. Foreign currency denominated assets and\\nliabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results\\nof operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of\\nexchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders\\u2019\\ndeficit in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included\\nin SG&A expense.\\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of the Company\\u2019s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles\\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates that affect the reported\\namounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\\nThe Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable,\\nall of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are\\nnot readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term\\ninvestments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash and cash equivalents are carried\\nat amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of payments due from financial institutions for\\nthe settlement of credit card and debit card transactions process within two business days and are, therefore,\\nclassified as cash and cash equivalents.\\nInvestments - Investments generally consist of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, governmental\\nsecurities, certificates of deposit, and money market funds, which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-\\nfor-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a\\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income. The proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt securities\\nwere insignificant for 2023 and $ 10million and $ 308million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross realized gains\\nand losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.\\nAlso included in long-term investments is performance-based contingent consideration associated with the sale of\\nthe Canadian retail business. The Company accounts for the contingent consideration under the fair value option\\nunder Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825, Financial Instruments, which requires the contingent\\nconsideration to be recorded at fair value upon recognition and as of each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes\\nin the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized within SG&A expense in the consolidated\\nstatements of earnings.\\nInvestments with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be\\nused in current operations are classified as short-term investments. All other investments are classified as long-\\nterm. Available-for-sale debt securities classified as long-term as of February 2, 2024, will mature in oneto three\\nyears, based on stated maturity dates.\\nThe Company classifies as investments restricted balances pledged as collateral for the Company\\u2019s extended\\nprotection plan program.Restricted balances included in short-term investments were $ 307million as of February 2,\\n2024, and $ 384million as\\n      \\n  43  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nof February 3, 2023. Restricted balances included in long-term investments were $ 252million as of February 2,\\n2024, and $ 100million as of February 3, 2023.\\nMerchandise Inventory - The majority of the Company\\u2019s inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable\\nvalue using the first-in, first-out method of inventory accounting. The cost of inventory includes certain costs\\nassociated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor\\nfunds.\\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.\\nThis reserve is based on management\\u2019s current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and\\nhistorical experience. Management does not believe the Company\\u2019s merchandise inventories are subject to significant\\nrisk of obsolescence in the near term in excess of established reserves, and management has the ability to adjust\\npurchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer\\npurchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.The Company\\u2019s reserve for loss on obsolete\\ninventory was $ 245million as of February 2, 2024, and $ 139million as of February 3, 2023.\\n\\nThe Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories. This\\nreserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories. Changes in the estimated\\nshrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories.The Company\\u2019s reserve for inventory\\nshrinkage was $ 425million as of February 2, 2024, and $ 428million as of February 3, 2023.\\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase\\nvolumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors\\u2019 products. Generally, these vendor funds do not\\nrepresent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the\\nvendor\\u2019s product. Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are\\nrecognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold. Funds that are determined to be\\nreimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors\\u2019 products are recorded as\\nan offset to the related expense. The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of\\nthe agreements in place. Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses\\nand reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the\\namounts earned are appropriately recorded. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase\\nvolumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for\\nincreased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates and\\nthe prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative\\nfinancial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at\\ntheir fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of\\nFebruary 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the\\nshortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in\\nfair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in fair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net\\nimpact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates\\non forecasted debt issuances as of February 3, 2023. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap\\nagreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company\\naccounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from\\nchanges in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated\\nstatements of comprehensive income and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt.\\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable - The Company has branded and private label proprietary\\ncredit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables. Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank\\n(Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony. All credit program-related services are\\nperformed and controlled directly by Synchrony. The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the\\nreceivables at the end of the agreement.\\nPrior to September 2023, the Company also had an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchased at face\\nvalue commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and services these accounts. The Company\\nprimarily accounted for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable. When the Company transferred its\\ncommercial business accounts receivable, it retained certain interests in those receivables, including the funding\\nof a loss reserve and its obligation\\n      \\n  44  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nrelated to Synchrony\\u2019s ongoing servicing of the receivables sold. Any gain or loss on the sale was determined based\\non the previous carrying amounts of the transferred assets allocated at fair value between the receivables sold and\\nthe interests retained. Fair value was based on the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into\\naccount the key assumptions of anticipated credit losses, payment rates, late fee rates, Synchrony\\u2019s servicing\\ncosts, and the discount rate commensurate with the uncertainty involved. Due to the short-term nature of the\\nreceivables sold, changes to the key assumptions would not materially impact the recorded gain or loss on the sales\\nof receivables or the fair value of the retained interests in the receivables.\\n\\nIn 2023, Synchrony exercised an option under the agreement to directly extend credit to the commercial accounts\\nreceivable customers, for which the related transition period was completed in August 2023. In 2023, prior to the\\noption\\u2019s effective date, $ 3.1billion of accounts receivable were sold to Synchrony and the Company recognized\\nlosses of $ 63million related to the servicing costs remitted to Synchrony monthly. In 2022 and 2021, total\\ncommercial business accounts receivable sold to Synchrony were $ 5.2billion and $ 4.3billion, respectively, and the\\nCompany recognized losses of $ 76million and $ 50million, respectively.\\nProperty and Depreciation - Property is recorded at cost. Costs associated with major additions are capitalized and\\ndepreciated. Capital assets are expected to yield future benefits and have original useful lives which exceed one\\nyear. The total cost of a capital asset generally includes all applicable sales taxes, delivery costs, installation\\ncosts, and other appropriate costs incurred by the Company, including interest in the case of self-constructed\\nassets. Upon disposal, the cost of properties and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts,\\nwith gains and losses reflected in SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\\nProperty consists of land, buildings and building improvements, equipment, and construction in progress. Buildings\\nand building improvements includes owned buildings, as well as buildings under finance lease and leasehold\\nimprovements. Equipment primarily includes store racking and displays, computer hardware and software, forklifts,\\nvehicles, finance lease equipment, and other store equipment . In addition, excess properties held for use are\\nincluded within land and buildings.\\nDepreciation is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Assets are depreciated using\\nthe straight-line method. Leasehold improvements and finance lease assets are depreciated and amortized,\\nrespectively, over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease. The amortization\\nof these assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment - The carrying amounts of long-lived assets are reviewed whenever certain events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. A potential impairment has\\noccurred for long-lived assets held-for-use if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the\\nuse and eventual disposition of the assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets. For operating\\nlocations identified for sale or closure, a market approach is used to determine the fair value of the asset group.\\nThe carrying value of an operating location\\u2019s asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease\\nright-of-use assets, and operating liabilities, including accounts payables, accrued compensation, and operating\\nlease liabilities. Financial and non-operating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group.\\nAn impairment loss is recorded for long-lived assets held-for-use when the carrying amount of the asset is not\\nrecoverable and exceeds its fair value. Impairment losses are included in SG&A expense in the consolidated\\nstatements of earnings.\\nExcess properties that are expected to be sold within the next twelve months and meet the other relevant held-for-\\nsale criteria are classified as long-lived assets held-for-sale. Excess properties consist primarily of retail\\noutparcels and property associated with relocated or closed locations. An impairment loss is recorded for long-\\nlived assets held-for-sale when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. A long-\\nlived asset is not depreciated while it is classified as held-for-sale.\\nFor long-lived assets to be abandoned, the Company considers the asset to be disposed of when it ceases to be used.\\nUntil it ceases to be used, the Company continues to classify the asset as held-for-use and tests for potential\\nimpairment accordingly. If the Company commits to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its\\npreviously estimated useful life, its depreciable life is evaluated.\\nLeases - The Company leases certain retail stores, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, land, and\\nequipment under finance and operating leases. Lease commencement occurs on the date the Company takes possession or\\ncontrol of the property or equipment. Original terms for facility-related leases are generally between fiveand\\n20years. These leases generally contain provisions for fourto sixrenewal options of five yearseach. Original terms\\nfor equipment-related leases, primarily material handling equipment and vehicles, are generally between oneand\\nseven years. Some of the Company\\u2019s leases also include rental escalation clauses and/or termination provisions.\\nRenewal options and termination options are included in the determination of lease payments when management\\ndetermines the options are reasonably certain of exercise, considering\\n      \\n  45  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nfinancial performance, strategic importance and/or invested capital. Leases with an original term of twelve months\\nor less are not recognized on the Company\\u2019s balance sheet, and the lease expense related to those short-term leases\\nis recognized over the lease term. The Company does not account for lease and non-lease (e.g., common area\\nmaintenance) components of contracts separately for any underlying asset class.\\n\\nIf readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value;\\nhowever, substantially all of the Company\\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. When the\\nimplicit rate is not determinable, the Company\\u2019s estimated incremental borrowing rate is utilized, determined on a\\ncollateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s real estate leases typically require payment of common area maintenance and real estate taxes which\\nrepresent the majority of variable lease costs. Certain lease agreements also provide for variable rental payments\\nbased on sales performance in excess of specified minimums, usage measures, or changes in the consumer price index.\\nVariable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices were not significant for any of\\nthe periods presented. Variable lease costs are excluded from the present value of lease obligations.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any material restrictions, covenants, or any material residual value\\nguarantees. The Company subleases certain properties that are not used in its operations. Sublease income was not\\nsignificant for any of the periods presented.\\nAccounts Payable - The Company has an agreement with a third party to provide a supplier finance program which\\nfacilitates participating suppliers\\u2019 ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with designated third-\\nparty financial institutions. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to finance one or\\nmore payment obligations of the Company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating\\nfinancial institutions. The Company\\u2019s goal in entering into these arrangements is to capture overall savings in the\\nform of pricing, payment terms, or vendor funding, created by facilitating suppliers\\u2019 ability to finance payment\\nobligations at more favorable discount rates, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility.\\nThe Company\\u2019s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by\\nsuppliers\\u2019 decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. However, the Company\\u2019s right to offset balances\\ndue from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by these arrangements for those payment obligations\\nthat have been financed by suppliers.

The Company has excess insurance coverage above certain\\nretention amounts to limit exposure from these claims. The Company is also self-insured for certain losses relating\\nto extended protection plans, as well as medical and dental claims. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred\\nbut not reported are accrued based upon management\\u2019s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured\\nclaims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. Although\\nmanagement believes it has the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual\\nresults could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. Total self-insurance liabilities, including the\\ncurrent and non-current portions, were $ 1.1billion as of February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023.\\nThe Company provides surety bonds issued by insurance companies to secure payment of workers\\u2019 compensation\\nliabilities as required in certain states where the Company is self-insured.Outstanding surety bonds relating to\\nself-insurance were $ 280million as of February 2, 2024, and $ 270million as of February 3, 2023.\\nIncome Taxes - The Company establishes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between\\nthe tax and financial accounting bases of assets and liabilities. The tax effects of such differences are reflected\\nin the consolidated balance sheets at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.\\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than\\nnot that all or a portion of the asset will not be realized. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by\\nthe Company are based on management\\u2019s interpretation of the tax statutes of multiple jurisdictions.\\nThe Company establishes a liability for tax positions for which there is uncertainty as to whether or not the\\nposition will be ultimately sustained. The Company includes interest related to tax issues as part of net interest\\non the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company records any applicable penalties related to tax issues\\nwithin the income tax provision.\\nIncome Tax Relief\\nIn October 2022, the Internal Revenue Service announced that businesses in certain states, including North\\nCarolina, affected by Hurricane Ian would receive tax relief by postponing certain tax-payment deadlines. Under\\nthis relief, the Company\\u2019s quarterly federal estimated income tax payments originally due by October 17, 2022, and\\nJanuary 17, 2023, were deferred until February 15, 2023. As of February 3, 2023, the Company deferred $ 1.2billion\\nof federal income taxes payable, which is included in income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet.\\nShareholders\\u2019 Deficit - The Company has a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from\\ntime to time either in the open market or through private market transactions. Shares purchased under the\\nrepurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status. Any excess of cost over par value is charged to\\nadditional paid-in capital to the extent that a balance is present. Once additional paid-in capital is fully\\ndepleted, remaining excess of cost over par value is charged to accumulated deficit.\\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases after December\\n31, 2022. Any excise tax incurred on share repurchases is recognized as part of the cost basis of the shares\\nacquired in the consolidated statements of shareholders\\u2019 (deficit)/equity.\\nRevenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an\\namount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or\\nservices. A description of the Company\\u2019s principle revenue generating activities is as follows:\\n\\u2022 Products - Revenue from products primarily relates to in-store and online merchandise purchases, which are\\nrecognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the merchandise. This occurs at the time of\\nin-store purchase or delivery of the product to the customer. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is\\nprovided through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded. The\\nmerchandise return reserve is presented on a gross basis, with a separate asset and liability included in the\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\n\\u2022 Services - Revenues from services primarily relate to professional installation services the Company provides\\nthrough subcontractors related to merchandise purchased by a customer. In certain instances, installation services\\ninclude materials provided by the subcontractor, and both product and installation are included in service revenue.\\nThe Company recognizes revenue associated with services as they are rendered, and the majority of services are\\ncompleted within one week from initiation.\\n      \\n  47  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nRetail deferred revenue consists of amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of the\\nmerchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed. Deferred revenue is recognized in sales either at\\na point in time when the customer obtains control of merchandise through pickup or delivery, or over time as\\nservices are provided to the customer. The majority of revenue for goods and services is recognized in the quarter\\nfollowing revenue deferral. In addition, the Company defers revenues from stored-value cards, which include gift\\ncards and returned merchandise credits, and recognizes revenue into sales when the cards are redeemed.\\n\\nThe Company also defers revenue for its separately-priced long-term protection plan contracts (Lowe\\u2019s protection\\nplans), which is a Lowe\\u2019s-branded program for which the Company is ultimately self-insured. The Company recognizes\\nrevenue from Lowe\\u2019s protection plan sales on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term. Expenses for\\nclaims are recognized in cost of sales when incurred. Incremental direct acquisition costs and administrative costs\\nto fulfill the contracts associated with Lowe's protection plans for contracts greater than one year are also\\ndeferred and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term. Lowe\\u2019s protection\\nplan contract terms primarily range from oneto five yearsfrom the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer\\u2019s\\nwarranty, as applicable.\\n\\nCost of Salesand Selling, General and Administrative Expenses -\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Cost of Sales                                            Selling, General and Administrative                     \\n  nTotal cost of products sold, including:                                                                         \\n  -  Purchase costs, net of vendor funds;                                                                          \\n  -  Freight expenses associated with moving                                                                       \\n  merchandise inventories from vendors to selling          nGenerally, payroll and benefit costs for retail and    \\n  locations;                                               corporate employees;                                    \\n  -  Costs associated with operating the Company\\u2019s         nOccupancy costs of retail and corporate facilities;    \\n  distribution network, including payroll and benefit      nAdvertising;                                           \\n  costs and occupancy costs;                               nStore environment costs;                               \\n  -  Depreciation of assets associated with the            nTender costs, including bank charges, costs            \\n  Company\\u2019s distribution network;                          associated with credit card interchange fees;           \\n  nCosts of installation services provided;                nCosts associated with self-insured plans, and premium  \\n  nCosts associated with shipping and handling to          costs for stop-loss coverage and fully insured plans;   \\n  customers, as well as directly from vendors to           nLong-lived asset impairment losses, gains/losses on    \\n  customers by third parties;                              disposal of assets, and exit costs;                     \\n  nDepreciation of assets used in delivering product to    nOther administrative costs, such as supplies, and      \\n  customers;                                               travel and entertainment.                               \\n  nCosts associated with inventory shrinkage and                                                                   \\n  obsolescence;                                                                                                    \\n  nCosts of services performed under the Lowe\\u2019s                                                                    \\n  protection plan.                                                                                                 \\n                                                                                                                   \\nAdvertising - Costs associated with advertising are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.Advertising expenses were $\\n831million, $ 869million, and $ 877million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\\n\\nComprehensive Income - The Company reports comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of comprehensive\\nincome and consolidated statements of shareholders\\u2019 (deficit)/equity.

in an\\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The three levels of the hierarchy are\\ndefined as follows:\\n\\n\\u2022 Level 1 - inputs to the valuation techniques that are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\\nliabilities\\n\\n\\u2022 Level 2 - inputs to the valuation techniques that are other than quoted prices but are observable for the assets\\nor liabilities, either directly or

For the fiscal year ended February 3,\\n2023, the Company\\u2019s only significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\\nsubsequent to their initial recognition were certain long-lived assets as further described below.\\n\\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances\\nindicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, the\\nasset group is generally at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are\\nidentifiable. Cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead. The Company\\nevaluates long-lived assets for triggering events on a quarterly basis to determine when assets may not be\\nrecoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal) group is not\\nrecoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company estimates the fair values of assets subject to long-lived asset\\nimpairment based on the Company\\u2019s own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\\nthe assets and on observable market data, when available. The Company classifies these fair value measurements as\\nLevel 3.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the assets within\\nthe Canadian retail business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their\\npreviously estimated useful lives, and these assets were evaluated for recoverability. Based on the proposed\\ntransaction, the Company reconsidered the appropriate asset grouping of long-lived assets attributable to the\\nCompany\\u2019s Canadian locations given the change in the Company\\u2019s expectations regarding use and disposition of its\\nassociated assets. The Company determined the total Canadian retail business (Canada asset group) to be the\\nappropriate asset group for which the long-lived assets should be evaluated, as this represented the lowest level\\nfor which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and\\nliabilities. The carrying value of the Canada asset group included substantially all assets and liabilities of the\\nCanadian retail business, including accounts receivable, inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-\\nuse assets, definite-lived intangible assets, operating liabilities including accounts payable and accrued\\ncompensation, and operating and finance lease liabilities. A market approach of orderly transaction under current\\nmarket conditions was used in determining the estimated fair value of the Canada asset group, which was based on\\nthe proposed transaction price, inclusive of performance-based contingent consideration. The estimated fair value\\nof the Canada asset group was determined to be $ 421million. As a result, the Company recorded $ 2.1billion of\\nlong-lived asset impairment within SG&A expensein the consolidated statements of earnings, which reflected the full\\ncarrying value of the long-lived assets of the Canada asset group as of October 28, 2022. As of February 3, 2023,\\nthe Company finalized the sale of the Canadian retail business.

On December 7, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors\\nauthorized $ 15.0billion of share repurchases under the program. As of February 2, 2024, the Company had $\\n14.6billion remaining under the program.\\n\\nDuring the year ended February 2, 2024, the Company entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreements with\\nthird-party financial institutions to repurchase a total of 15.4million shares of the Company\\u2019s common stock for $\\n3.3billion. At inception, the Company paid the financial institutions using cash on hand and took initial delivery\\nof shares. Under the terms of the ASR agreements, upon settlement, the Company would either receive additional\\nshares from the financial institution or be required to deliver additional shares or cash to the financial\\ninstitution. The Company controlled its election to either deliver additional shares or cash to the financial\\ninstitution and was subject to provisions which limited the number of shares the Company would be required to\\ndeliver.\\n\\nThe final number of shares received upon settlement of each ASR agreement was determined with reference to the\\nvolume-weighted average price of the Company\\u2019s common stock over the term of the ASR agreement.

The Company also has an employee stock\\npurchase plan (the ESPP) that allows employees to purchase Company shares at a discount through payroll deductions.\\nBoth of these plans contain a non-discretionary anti-dilution provision that is designed to equalize the value of\\nan award as a result of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, or any other similar equity\\nrestructuring.\\n\\nA total of 80.0million shares were authorized for grants of share-based awards to key employees and non-employee\\ndirectors under the Company\\u2019s currently active Incentive Plan, of which there were 24.6million shares remaining\\navailable for grants as of February 2, 2024. The 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) permits a maximum of\\n20.0million shares to be offered for purchase. As of February 2, 2024, there were 18.1million s hares remaining\\navailable for purchase.\\n      \\n  59  \\n      \\nTable of Content s\\n\\nThe Company recognized share-based payment expense within SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings\\nof $ 210million, $ 224million, and $ 230million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The total associated income\\ntax benefit recognized, exclusive of excess tax benefits, was $ 30million, $ 36million, and $ 40million in 2023,\\n2022, and 2021, respectively.\\n\\nTotal unrecognized share-based payment expense for all share-based payment plans was $ 248million as of February 2,\\n2024, of which $ 147million will be recognized in 2024, $ 85million in 2025, and $ 16million thereafter. This\\nresults in these amounts being recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4years.\\n\\nFor all share-based payment awards, the expense recognized has been adjusted for estimated forfeitures where the\\nrequisite service is not expected to be met. Estimated forfeiture rates are developed based on the Company\\u2019s\\nanalysis of historical forfeiture data for homogeneous employee groups.\\n\\nGeneral terms and methods of valuation for the Company\\u2019s share-based awards are as follows:\\n\\nStock Options\\n\\nStock options have terms of 10years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years, subsequent to\\nthe date of the grant, and are assigned an exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of the\\nCompany\\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Options are expensed on a straight-line basis over the grant vesting\\nperiod, which is considered to be the requisite service period.\\n\\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\\nWhen determining expected volatility, the Company considers the historical volatility of the Company\\u2019s stock price,\\nas well as implied volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at\\nthe time of grant, based on the options\\u2019 expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the Company\\u2019s\\nevaluation of option holders\\u2019 exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options are expected to\\nremain unexercised. The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures. The weighted\\naverage assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and weighted-average grant date fair value for\\noptions granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021 are as follows:\\n

Wireless local area networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi, link two or more nearby devices  \\nwirelessly and usually provide connectivity through an access point. Wi-Fi systems are based on standards developed\\nby the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in the 802.11 family of standards. 802.11ac, which \\nincludes advanced features such as multiple user multiple in/multiple out (MU MIMO) and support for large          \\nbandwidths and higher order modulation, primarily targets broadband connectivity for mobile devices, laptops and   \\nconsumer electronics devices using 5 GHz spectrum. 802.11ad provides multi-gigabit data rates for short range      \\ncommunication, using 60 GHz spectrum. 802.11ah, which is still under development and targets sub-GHz spectrum, is  \\nenvisioned to be a solution for \\u201cconnected home\\u201d                                                                   \\n                                                         7                                                         \\napplications that require long battery life. We played a leading role in the development of 802.11ac, 802.11ad and \\n802.11ah, and we are actively involved in the development of 802.11ax, which is an evolution from 802.11ac and will\\ncover both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz unlicensed bands.                                                                   \\n                                                                                                                   \\nBluetooth. Bluetooth is a wireless personal area network that provides wireless connectivity between devices over  \\nshort distances ranging from a few centimeters to a few meters. Bluetooth technology provides wireless connectivity\\nto a wide range of fixed or mobile consumer electronics devices. Bluetooth functionalities are standardized by the \\nBluetooth Special Interest Group in various versions of the specification (from 1.0 to 4.0), which include         \\ndifferent functionalities, such as enhanced data rate or low energy (known as Bluetooth Smart). We recently        \\nacquired CSR plc, a leading contributor to Bluetooth evolution in the areas of core, HID (human interface device), \\nA/V (audio/ video) and Smart Mesh.                                                                                 \\n                                                                                                                   \\nLocation Positioning Technologies. Location positioning technologies have evolved rapidly in the industry over the \\npast few years in order to deliver an enhanced location experience. In the past, satellite navigation systems were \\npredominantly used to provide the accurate location of mobile devices. We were a key developer of the Assisted-GPS \\n(A-GPS) positioning technology used in most cellular handsets today. For uses requiring the best accuracy for E911 \\nservices and navigational based services, A-GPS provided a leading-edge solution.                                  \\n                                                                                                                   \\nThe industry has now evolved to support additional inputs for improving the location experience. We now support    \\nmultiple constellations, including: GPS, GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and BeiDou; terrestrial-based\\npositioning using WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network) and Wi-Fi-based inputs; Wi-Fi RSSI (received signal strength   \\nindication) and RTT (round-trip time) signals for indoor location; and third-party sensors combined with GNSS      \\n(Global Navigation Satellite System) measurements to provide interim support for location-based services in rural  \\nareas and indoors, where other signal inputs may not be available.                                                 \\n                                                                                                                   \\nOther Significant Technologies used in Cellular and Certain Consumer Electronic Devices and Networks               \\n                                                                                                                   \\nWe have played a leading role in developing many of the other technologies used in cellular and certain consumer   \\nelectronic devices and networks, including:                                                                        \\n                                                     \\n  \\u2022  graphics and display processing functionality;  \\n                                                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\n     video coding based on H.264 standards, which has already been deployed commercially, and its successor,       \\n  \\u2022  H.265, or high-efficiency video codec, which will be deployed to support ultra-high definition (4K) video     \\n     content;                                                                                                      \\n                                                                                                                   \\n                                                                                                    \\n  \\u2022  audio coding, including for multimedia use and for voice/speech use (also known as Vocoding);  \\n                                                                                                    \\n                                      \\n  \\u2022  camera and camcorder functions;  \\n                                      \\n                                          \\n  \\u2022  system user and interface features;  \\n                                          \\n                                               \\n  \\u2022  security and content protection systems;  \\n                                               \\n                                                                                           \\n  \\u2022  volatile (LP-DDR2, 3, 4) and non-volatile (eMMC) memory and related controllers; and  \\n                                                                                           \\n                                              \\n  \\u2022  power management systems and batteries.  \\n                                              \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Operating Segments                                                                                               \\n                                                                                                                   \\nWe have three reportable segments.

Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers    \\nthat have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package supports the  \\nelectrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the    \\nessential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit   \\ncost. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is    \\nwhen our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the\\ntwo-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries\\nand contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and\\nfinal test.                                                                                                        \\n                                                                                                                   \\nWe rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of\\nour integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are       \\nresponsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. The\\nprimary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits are Global   \\nFoundries Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.

QCT generally allows     \\ncustomers to reschedule delivery dates within a defined time frame and to cancel orders prior to shipment with or  \\nwithout payment of a penalty, depending on when the order is canceled. The industry in which QCT operates is       \\nintensely competitive. QCT competes worldwide with a number of United States and international designers and       \\nmanufacturers of semiconductors. As a result of global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological\\nchanges, device manufacturer concentrations and the potential for further industry consolidation, we anticipate the\\nindustry to remain very competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our products include    \\nperformance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry standards, price, time-to-market, system cost,\\ndesign and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and customer support. QCT also competes in both single-\\nand multi-mode environments against alternative communications technologies including, but not limited to,         \\nGSM/GPRS/EDGE, TDMA and TD-SCDMA.                                                                                  \\n                                                                                                                   \\nQCT\\u2019s current competitors include, but are not limited to, companies such as Airoha Technology Corp., Broadcom,    \\nEricsson, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, MediaTek, Microchip        \\nTechnology Inc., Nvidia, Realtek Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics and Spreadtrum Communications (which is        \\ncontrolled by Tsinghua Unigroup). QCT also faces competition from products internally developed by our customers,  \\nincluding some of our largest customers, and from some early-stage companies. Our competitors devote significant   \\namounts of their financial, technical and other resources to develop and market competitive products and, in some  \\ncases, to develop and adopt competitive digital communication or signal processing technologies, and those efforts \\nmay materially and adversely affect us. Although we have attained a significant position in the industry, many of  \\nour current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: lower cost           \\nstructures; motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed         \\nintegrated circuit products or to find alternate suppliers or choose alternate technologies; foreign government    \\nsupport of other technologies or our competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing \\nfacilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution  \\ncompanies and original equipment manufacturers in emerging geographic regions (such as China); and/or a more       \\nestablished presence in certain regions.                                                                           \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  QTL Segment.                                                                                                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\nQTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which,    \\namong other rights, include certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain\\nwireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD, and/or LTE      \\nstandards and their derivatives.

If we are unable to attract   \\nand retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.                                                        \\n                                                                                                                   \\nCurrency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues, harm our ability to collect\\nreceivables or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our products or the activities of our foreign subsidiaries and     \\nstrategic investments.                                                                                             \\n                                                                                                                   \\nOur customers sell their products throughout the world in various currencies.

We record impairment charges through the statement of  \\noperations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination \\nthat a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Adverse changes in market     \\nconditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying   \\nvalue of the investments, thereby requiring recognition of impairment losses. When assessing these investments for \\nan other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the significance of the \\ndecline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of      \\nsecurities in a single asset class; how long the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis;   \\nthe security\\u2019s relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; expected market volatility; the market\\nand economy in general; analyst recommendations and price targets; views of external investment managers; news or  \\nfinancial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in \\nwhich the investee operates, as applicable. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, \\nwe record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2015 ,\\n2014 and 2013 , we recorded $163 million , $156 million and $72 million , respectively, in impairment losses on our\\ninvestments in marketable securities.                                                                              \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Valuation of Inventories.                                                                                        \\n                                                                                                                   \\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost, not to exceed net realizable value) using \\nthe first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventories is assessed based on review of future customer demand\\nthat considers multiple factors, including committed purchase orders from customers as well as purchase commitment \\nprojections provided by customers, among other things.

If we overestimate demand for our products, the amount of our   \\nloss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchases from our suppliers.

Our business acquisitions typically result\\nin the recording of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, and the recorded values of\\nthose assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\\nin other types of transactions. The determination of the recorded value of intangible assets acquired in a business\\ncombination requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial           \\nstatements. For intangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets     \\ntransferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish   \\ntheir recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable\\nwithin reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets\\ntransferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are    \\nused to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant \\njudgment. For example, the income approach generally requires us to use assumptions to estimate future cash flows  \\nincluding those related to total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology          \\nobsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ     \\nmaterially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models.      \\n                                                        36                                                         \\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if \\ncertain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property,    \\nplant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is       \\nevidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may  \\nnot be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to\\ngoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets may be based on operational performance\\nof our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent     \\nuncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash \\nflows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their \\nrelated assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of \\nour goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and/or long-lived assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the\\noccurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset      \\nvalues. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other       \\nintangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an\\nadverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. During fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we        \\nrecorded $317 million , $642 million and $192 million , respectively, in impairment charges for goodwill, other    \\nindefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. The estimated fair values of our QCT and QTL reporting   \\nunits were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values at September 27, 2015.                      \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Legal Proceedings.                                                                                               \\n                                                                                                                   \\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves.  \\nHowever, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. A broad range of remedies with respect to  \\nour business practices that are deemed to violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may    \\ninclude, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of     \\norders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our business practices. We disclose a loss contingency if there is\\nat least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. We record our best estimate of a loss    \\nrelated to pending legal proceedings when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably         \\nestimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, we record the     \\nminimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability,       \\nincluding the probability of loss related to pending legal proceedings, and revise our estimates and update our    \\ndisclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the         \\ndetermination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable.

Our failure to meet these criteria could adversely impact our    \\nprovision for income taxes.                                                                                        \\n                                                                                                                   \\nWe consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside \\nthe United States based on our plans for use and/or investment outside of the United States and our belief that our\\nsources of cash and liquidity in the United States will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. On a     \\nregular basis, we consider projected cash needs for, among other things, investments in our existing businesses,   \\nfuture research and development, potential acquisitions and capital transactions, including repurchases of our     \\ncommon stock, dividends and debt repayments. We estimate the amount of cash or other liquidity that is available or\\nneeded in the jurisdictions where these investments are expected as well as our ability to generate cash in those  \\njurisdictions and our access to capital markets.

The decrease and increase in QCT revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $1.51       \\nbillion and $1.95 billion , respectively, were primarily due to changes in equipment and services revenues.        \\nEquipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits,    \\nwere $16.95 billion , $18.43 billion and $16.49 billion in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer  \\nof goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange\\nfor those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step approach for recognizing revenue, which may require a \\ncompany to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. This ASU, as amended, will be\\neffective for us starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The FASB will also permit entities to adopt one year\\nearlier if they choose. The new standard allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective adoption,      \\nmeaning the standard is applied to all periods presented or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the       \\ncumulative effect of applying the new standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings     \\nbalance. We do not intend to adopt the standard early and are in the process of determining the adoption method as \\nwell as the effects the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements.                               \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Non-GAAP Financial Information                                                                                   \\n                                                                                                                   \\nThis Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to  \\nfree cash flow and return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of free cash flow.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule  \\nlisted in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set   \\nforth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the\\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September  \\n27, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee \\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company\\u2019s management is responsible for these   \\nfinancial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial   \\nreporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\\naccompanying Management\\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our         \\nresponsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the\\nCompany\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in     \\naccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards    \\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  \\nare free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in\\nall material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence        \\nsupporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and   \\nsignificant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of\\ninternal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial   \\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating \\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other       \\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis  \\nfor our opinions.                                                                                                  \\n                                                                                                                   \\nA company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance        \\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes \\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

For the remaining debt securities, if an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company separates \\nthe other-than-temporary impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors, or the credit loss     \\nportion, which is recorded as a charge to net investment income, and the portion of the loss that is not related to\\ncredit factors, or the noncredit loss portion, which is recorded as a component of other accumulated comprehensive \\nincome, net of income taxes.                                                                                       \\n                                                                                                                   \\nFor equity securities, the Company considers the loss relative to the expected volatility and the likelihood of    \\nrecovery over a reasonable period of time. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of an  \\nequity security has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a charge to net investment income for\\nthe difference between fair value and cost at the balance sheet date. Additionally, if the Company has either the  \\nintent to sell the equity security or does not have both the intent and the ability to hold the equity security    \\nuntil its anticipated recovery, the Company records a charge to net investment income for the difference between   \\nfair value and cost at the balance sheet date.                                                                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Derivatives.                                                                                                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\nThe Company\\u2019s primary objectives for holding derivative instruments are to manage interest rate risk on its long-  \\nterm debt and to manage foreign exchange risk for certain foreign currency revenue and operating expenditure       \\ntransactions. To a lesser extent, the Company also holds derivative instruments in its investment portfolios to    \\nmanage risk by acquiring or reducing foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and/or equity, prepayment and credit\\nrisk. Additionally, the Company may use derivative instruments as part of its stock repurchase program. Derivative \\ninstruments are recorded at fair value and included in other current assets, noncurrent assets, other accrued      \\nliabilities or other noncurrent liabilities based on their maturity dates. Counterparties to the Company\\u2019s         \\nderivative instruments are all major banking institutions.                                                         \\n                                                                                                                   \\nInterest Rate Swaps: The Company manages its exposure to certain interest rate risks related to its long-term debt \\nthrough the use of interest rate swaps. Such swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments    \\ninto floating-rate payments based on LIBOR. These transactions are designated as fair value hedges, and the gains  \\nand losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair\\nvalue of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in the market interest rates.  \\nThe net gains and losses on the interest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related      \\nfixed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risks, are recognized in earnings as interest expense in the current    \\nperiod. The interest settlement payments associated with the interest rate swap agreements are classified as cash  \\nflows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.                                      \\n                                                                                                                   \\nAt September 27, 2015 , the aggregate fair value of the Company\\u2019s interest rate swaps related to its long-term debt\\nof $32 million was recorded in total assets. The swaps had an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion , which    \\neffectively converted all of the fixed-rate debt due in 2018 and approximately 43% and 50% of the fixed-rate debt  \\ndue in 2020 and 2022, respectively, into floating-rate debt. The maturities of the swaps match the Company\\u2019s fixed-\\nrate debt due in 2018, 2020 and 2022. There were no such interest rate swaps outstanding at September 28, 2014 .   \\n                                                                                                                   \\nForeign Currency Hedges: The Company manages its exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed            \\nappropriate, through the use of derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts    \\nwith financial counterparties. These derivative instruments mature between one and nine months. Gains and losses   \\narising from the effective portion of such contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are      \\nrecorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income as gains and losses on derivative instruments,   \\nnet of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently       \\nreclassified to revenues or costs and expenses, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations in the \\nsame period in which the underlying transactions affect the Company\\u2019s earnings. Gains and losses arising from the  \\nineffective portion of such contracts are recorded in net investment income as gains and losses on derivative      \\ninstruments.

Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their  \\nuseful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. For intangible assets purchased in a business       \\ncombination, the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values. For     \\nintangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the \\nestimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values,\\nunless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable     \\nlimits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred.     \\nValuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure \\nfair value.                                                                                                        \\n                                                                                                                   \\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived   \\nintangible assets are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain\\nevents occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. If a qualitative assessment is used and the     \\nCompany determines that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than\\nnot (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be    \\nperformed. If goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment, a two-step approach is applied. First, the       \\nCompany compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying      \\nvalue. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair     \\nvalue of goodwill to its carrying value. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for  \\nimpairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value \\nexceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment.                                               \\n                                                                                                                   \\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are        \\nreviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  \\namount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured \\nby comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to\\nbe generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated  \\nfuture cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or  \\nasset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by   \\nsale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are \\nnot depreciated.                                                                                                   \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Revenue Recognition.                                                                                             \\n                                                                                                                   \\nThe Company derives revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, licensing of its intellectual  \\nproperty and sales of software hosting, software development and other services.

The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer  \\nof goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange\\nfor those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step approach for recognizing revenue, which may require a \\ncompany to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. This ASU, as amended, will be\\neffective for the Company starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The FASB will also permit entities to adopt\\none year earlier if they choose. The new standard allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective       \\nadoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning \\nthe cumulative effect of applying the new standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings \\nbalance. The Company does not intend to adopt the standard early and is in the process of determining the adoption \\nmethod as well as the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\nNote 2.

ParkerVision\\u2019s complaint \\nsought damages and injunctive and other relief. Subsequently, ParkerVision narrowed its allegations to assert only \\nfour patents. On October 17, 2013, the jury returned a verdict finding all asserted claims of the four at-issue    \\npatents to be infringed and finding that none of the asserted claims are invalid. On October 24, 2013, the jury    \\nreturned a separate verdict assessing total past damages of $173 million and finding that the Company\\u2019s            \\ninfringement was not willful. The Company recorded the verdict amount in fiscal 2013 as a charge in other expenses.\\nPost-verdict motions, including the Company\\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial on invalidity\\nand non-infringement and ParkerVision\\u2019s motions for injunctive relief and ongoing royalties, were filed by January \\n24, 2014. A hearing on these motions was held on May 1, 2014. On June 20, 2014, the court granted the Company\\u2019s    \\nmotion to overturn the infringement verdict, denied the Company\\u2019s motion to overturn the invalidity verdict, and   \\ndenied the remaining motions as moot. The court then entered judgment in the Company\\u2019s favor. As a result of the   \\ncourt\\u2019s judgment, the Company is not liable for any damages to ParkerVision, and therefore, the Company reversed   \\nall recorded amounts related to the damages verdict in fiscal 2014. On June 25, 2014, ParkerVision filed a notice  \\nof appeal with the court. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal on May 8, 2015 and issued a\\ndecision on July 31, 2015. The decision affirmed the District Court\\u2019s finding of non-infringement and granted in   \\npart the Company\\u2019s cross-appeal, holding 10 of the 11 asserted claims invalid. A subsequent Petition for Rehearing \\nby ParkerVision was denied on October 2, 2015. On May 1, 2014, ParkerVision filed another complaint against the    \\nCompany in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging patent infringement.

QUALCOMM Incorporated : On September 4, 2014, Nvidia filed a complaint in the United States  \\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware and also with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)   \\npursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the Company, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and other    \\nSamsung entities, alleging infringement of seven patents related to graphics processing. In the ITC complaint,     \\nNvidia seeks an exclusion order barring the importation of certain consumer electronics and display device         \\nproducts, including some that incorporate the Company\\u2019s chipset products, that infringe, induce infringement and/or\\ncontribute to the infringement of at least one of the seven asserted graphics processing patents as well as a cease\\nand desist order preventing the Company from carrying out commercial activities within the United States related to\\nsuch products. In the District of Delaware complaint, Nvidia is seeking an award of damages for the infringement of\\nthe asserted patents, a finding that such infringement is willful and treble damages for such willful infringement,\\nand an order permanently enjoining the Company from infringing the asserted patents. The ITC instituted an         \\ninvestigation into Nvidia\\u2019s allegations on October 6, 2014. On April 2, 2015, the Administrative Law Judge in the  \\nITC investigation issued a claim construction order construing seven claim terms from five of the seven asserted   \\npatents. The evidentiary hearing for the investigation was held from June 22 to 25, 2015. Nvidia narrowed the case \\nto three asserted patents. On October 9, 2015, the Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Determination finding\\nno violation of Section 337 because none of the three patents were both valid and infringed. On October 22, 2015,  \\nthe Administrative Law Judge issued a recommendation that, if the ITC were to find any violation of Section 337 in \\nthe investigation, the ITC should issue a limited exclusion order directed at Samsung\\u2019s accused products and a     \\ncease and desist order against Samsung but not the Company. On October 26, 2015, Nvidia filed a petition requesting\\nthe ITC to review the Initial Determination as to two of the asserted patents, but is no longer pursuing           \\ninfringement allegations with respect to the third patent. The target date for completion of the ITC investigation \\nis scheduled for February 10, 2016.

Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including\\ndepreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not  \\nallocated to segments in the Company\\u2019s management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the        \\nsegments\\u2019 operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense; certain net      \\ninvestment income; certain share-based compensation; and certain research and development expenses, selling,       \\ngeneral and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the\\nbusinesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories to \\nfair value, amortization and impairment of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges,\\nand beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and      \\ncertain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, goodwill and long-lived\\nasset impairment charges and litigation settlements and/or damages.

We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on\\nportions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal\\nCommunication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C block, AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and\\n2100 MHz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the U.S., and 3700-3900 MHz, also\\nknown as C-Band. We have also deployed 4G technologies in 3.5 Gigahertz (GHz) shared spectrum, using LTE/Citizens\\nBroadband Radio Service, and in 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum, using LTE/Licensed Assisted Access. All of this spectrum\\nis collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. We are using our low and mid-band spectrum to provide 4G LTE and\\n5G wireless services. As of December 31, 2022, we retired our 3G service. We are increasingly reallocating spectrum\\npreviously used for 3G service to provide 4G LTE service, and we completed that transition where needed at the end\\nof 2022. We are also utilizing additional low and mid-band spectrum for 5G through DSS to complement both our\\nC-Band and our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 GHz band, collectively called millimeter wave spectrum.\\n\\nMillimeter wave spectrum is being used in conjunction with low and mid-band spectrum for our 5G technology\\ndeployment. We own millimeter wave spectrum predominantly in the 28 GHz and 37/39 GHz bands. Millimeter wave\\nspectrum is currently being used to increase capacity for mobile and fixed wireless services in areas of high\\ndemand. We anticipate that demand will continue to increase over time, driven by growth in customer connections and\\nthe increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as\\nwell as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We expect to meet the demand for 4G and 5G spectrum\\nneeds with our existing spectrum assets. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a\\nfuture generation of technology, we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other\\nlicensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur.\\n\\nWe use low and mid-band spectrum and DSS technology, to allow 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on\\nmultiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon\\u2019s millimeter wave and C-Band coverage\\nareas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum bands where this network is\\navailable. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G and\\n5G customers.\\n\\nFrom time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary\\nmarket swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order\\nto meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum\\nswaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market.\\nContiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases,\\nrequire us to obtain governmental approvals.\\n                                                         8                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nInformation regarding spectrum license transactions is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements\\nof Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries.\\n                                  \\n  Competition and Related Trends  \\n                                  \\nThe telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development of new technologies, services and\\nproducts has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long\\ndistance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense\\nas traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.\\n\\nWith respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service\\nproviders, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We\\nalso compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers,\\nincluding Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation\\nand Charter Communications, Inc., and others. Competition remains intense as a result of various factors, including\\nhigh rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, increased network investment by our competitors, the\\ndevelopment and deployment of new technologies, including 5G, the introduction of new products and services,\\nofferings that include additional bundled premium content, increased levels of promotions and service plan\\ndiscounts, new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and regulatory\\nchanges. In addition, increasing government incentives related to network deployment may enhance the ability of\\ncertain of our competitors to compete with us. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless\\nservice providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs\\nresell wireless communication services. In addition, DISH Network Corporation has committed to deploy a facilities-\\nbased 5G broadband network in each of its license areas capable of serving at least 70% of the U.S. population by\\nJune 2023, which could result in additional competitive pressures in the U.S. wireless industry.\\n\\nWe also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand\\nrecognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in\\naddition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple\\nInc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls\\nthat, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means\\nof accessing video content. In addition, we expect to see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet\\naccess by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless offerings that provide an\\nalternative to traditional landline internet service providers.\\n\\nWith respect to our wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers,\\ndomestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers,\\nover-the-top (OTT) providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. We\\nalso face increasing competition from other providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal providers. Cable\\noperators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services.\\nSeveral major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Traditional\\nwireless carriers are also bundling broadband internet offerings with wireless services while increasing their\\nbroadband internet footprint. Customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content from\\nvarious online services. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT\\nofferings. We also expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a\\ngrowing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a\\nlandline alternative.\\n\\nWe believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications\\nindustry:\\n\\n\\u2022 Network reliability, speed, capacity and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality,\\nfast and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. With the\\ndevelopment of 5G technologies, wireless service providers are increasingly focusing their marketing efforts on\\nnetwork quality, speed and coverage, sometimes directly targeting customers of Verizon. In addition, lower prices,\\nimproved service quality and new service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to\\nincreased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our\\nnetworks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage.\\n\\n\\u2022 Pricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the\\nwireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers\\nare offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless\\nservice offerings with other content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted\\nspecifically to customers of Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers,\\noffer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of\\ntime, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become\\nmore common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as\\nretaining existing customers. Pricing also plays an important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as\\ntraditional service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy\\nproducts. In addition, as non-traditional modes of providing wireline communication services emerge, new entrants\\nattempt to capture market share from incumbents\\n                                                         9                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nusing competitive pricing. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free\\nfor customers and supported by advertising revenues.\\n\\n\\u2022 Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and\\nattracting new customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction\\nprograms are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on\\ntheir needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn.\\n\\nCustomer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and\\nOther customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of\\nour networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small and Medium Business\\ncustomers through service representatives and online support, as well as through store-based representatives for\\nsmall business customers. For Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system\\nautomation initiatives.\\n\\n\\u2022 Product differentiation. Customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and\\nenhanced products and services, as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating.\\nCustomers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband,\\nvideo and wireless connections. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine\\ntheir product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of\\ncustomers. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative products and services,\\nboth independently and in collaboration with application providers, content providers and device manufacturers.\\nFeatures such as wireless and wireline inter-operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both\\ncustomer demand and technological advancement.\\n\\n\\u2022 Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of\\nthe wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary\\ndistribution channels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, web-based sales and\\nfulfillment capabilities, outside sales teams and telemarketing, our extensive indirect distribution network of\\nretail outlets and our sale of wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end users.\\n\\nIn addition to these competitive factors and trends, our competitive position also depends on our ability to market\\nour products and services effectively, anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our\\nindustries, as well as the availability of capital resources.\\n\\nCompanies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A relatively small\\nnumber of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global\\nenterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large\\ncontracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies\\nhave strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to\\nintensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.\\n\\nIn the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution\\nspeed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumer-like \\\"look and feel\\\" are becoming key\\ndifferentiators for customers who are seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running\\nand growing their businesses. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through\\nstrategic relationships.\\n\\nIn the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result\\nof increased industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers,\\nand hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology services companies are\\nmaking strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost\\nstructure. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software\\ndefined networking, communication applications and other computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of\\nin-house machines.\\n\\nOur Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile\\nvideo and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche\\nplayers are competitors for this business opportunity.\\n                     \\n  Regulatory Trends  \\n                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Regulatory Landscape                                                                                             \\n                                                                                                                   \\nVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above.

Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the\\nconstruction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require\\nuse of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand\\ncontinues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs\\nfor licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive\\nbidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and\\npotential conditions.\\n\\nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications\\nservices, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which\\ntime they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon\\u2019s wireless licenses,\\nchallenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be\\npermitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply\\nwith so-called \\\"open access\\\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow\\ncustomers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has\\nalso imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage\\nrequirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and\\nrequirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities.\\n\\nThe Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by,\\nwireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other \\\"terms and conditions\\\" of wireless\\nservice. For example, some states impose reporting and consumer protection requirements. Several states also have\\nlaws or regulations that address safety issues (for example, use of wireless handsets while driving), universal\\nservice funding, and taxation matters. Some states are also considering new network reliability or service quality\\nrequirements that may affect how and where we provide services if not preempted by federal law. In addition,\\nwireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and\\nsecuring approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Broadband                                                                                                        \\n                                                                                                                   \\nVerizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services\\nas \\\"information services\\\" subject to a \\\"light touch\\\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-\\nstyle regulations. However, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally,\\nseveral states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would regulate broadband.\\nAlthough some of these have been challenged in court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules\\nis uncertain.

For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered\\nto be \\\"common carrier\\\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with\\nrespect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory\\nclassification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities\\nand law enforcement assistance requirements.\\n\\nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon\\u2019s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications\\nintrastate matters. Verizon operates as an \\\"incumbent local exchange carrier\\\" in nine states and the District of\\nColumbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight\\nand requirements.

In order to realize our core business\\nstrategy, we have developed human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees\\nfrom the time they join our team through the entirety of their careers with Verizon. These programs are centered on\\nthe following principles:\\n\\n\\u2022 Attract the right talent for our future and maintain a diverse workforce with high-value skills and expertise.\\n\\n\\u2022 Develop our employees to their full potential through best-in-class educational programs and exceptional\\ndevelopment experiences and create a culture of continuous learning and engagement.\\n\\n\\u2022 Inspire individuals to build a career at Verizon by providing meaningful work and upskilling opportunities and\\nestablishing an inclusive work environment for all.\\n\\nVerizon is committed to being an employer of choice. With approximately 117,100 employees on a full-time equivalent\\nbasis as of December 31, 2022, 89% of whom are based in the U.S., we know that we need employees with diverse\\nbackgrounds, experiences and perspectives to best meet the needs of the diverse customers and communities we serve.\\nOur human capital programs and practices are designed to create a workplace where employees are empowered to share\\ntheir authentic selves and feel seen and heard as vital contributors to Verizon\\u2019s corporate purpose. In addition,\\nVerizon has extensive on-the-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development\\nsupport to enable our employees to maximize their potential and thrive professionally. Our long-standing commitment\\nto diversity and inclusion has resulted in a strong representation of women and people of color. As of December 31,\\n2022, Verizon's global workforce was approximately 66.5% male, 33.3% female and 0.2% unknown or undeclared, and the\\nrace/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was 52.5% White, 20.0% Black, 12.9% Hispanic, 8.2% Asian, 0.5% American\\nIndian/Alaskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 2.7% two or more races, and 2.9% unknown or\\nundeclared.

People of color\\nrepresented 32.5% of U.S. senior leadership.\\n\\nVerizon respects our employees\\u2019 rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with\\napplicable law, including the right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the\\nCommunications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\\u2014the two unions that in\\ntotal represent approximately 22.5% of our employees as of December 31, 2022. The current collective bargaining\\nagreements covering our union-represented employees who serve customers in our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast service\\nareas extend through August 1, 2026. In addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee\\nrepresentative bodies such as works council. Verizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as\\nworks council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, including safety, customer service,\\nplans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology and\\ncompetition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy.\\n\\nFor a discussion of the oversight provided by the Company's Board of Directors over Verizon's human capital\\nmanagement practices, see the section entitled \\\"Governance \\u2014 Our Governance Framework \\u2014 Oversight of human capital\\nmanagement\\\" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered\\nto shareholders in connection with our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\\n                                                        12                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n                                    \\n  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses  \\n                                    \\nWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property\\nrights necessary to conduct our business.

This information should be read in conjunction with \\\"Management\\u2019s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\\\" and the consolidated financial statements\\nand related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we\\nbelieve are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could\\ncause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in\\nforward-looking statements.\\n                                \\n  Economic and Strategic Risks  \\n                                \\nWe face significant competition that may reduce our profits.\\nWe face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products\\nhas eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance\\ncommunication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telecommunications companies,\\ncable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, technology companies and application and device\\nproviders. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed\\nother providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively,\\nwe could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings.\\n\\nWireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through\\ncommercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided \\u2013 in\\nsome cases specifically targeting our customers and putting pressure on pricing and margins. In addition, the\\nwireless industry\\u2019s customer growth rate could moderate in comparison to historical growth rates, leading to\\nincreased competition for customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our\\nnetwork quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer\\nservice, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and\\ndistribution channels, our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources. It\\nwill also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries,\\nincluding new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services,\\ndemographic trends and evolving economic conditions, including inflation. If we are not able to respond\\nsuccessfully to these competitive challenges, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely\\nimpacted. In addition, a projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a\\nsignificant negative impact on its fair value and result in an impairment charge, which could have an adverse\\nimpact on our results of operations.\\nIf we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely\\nbasis, or if the deployment of our 5G network is delayed or hindered for any reason, we\\n                                                        14                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\nmay experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and\\nexperience reduced profits.\\nOur industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for\\ntheir communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain\\ncompetitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce\\nnew offerings to address our customers\\u2019 changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing\\ntechnologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be\\nable to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. If our new services\\nfail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of\\nthese services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected.\\n\\nIn addition, the deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to\\nequipment and spectrum availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory matters that could cause deployment delays or\\nnetwork performance issues. These issues could result in significant costs, put us at a competitive disadvantage,\\nor reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks.\\n\\nAs we introduce new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable\\ntechnologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced\\nprofits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.\\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations and financial\\ncondition.\\nUnfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, or inflation in\\nthe markets in which we operate, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products\\nand services and our cost of doing business. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce\\ndiscretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services,\\ndropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly,\\nunder these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full\\nimplementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may\\nlead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. Unfavorable\\neconomic conditions could also amplify other risk factors discussed in this section, including, but not limited to,\\nour competitive position and margins. In 2022, as a result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we\\nexperienced increases in our direct costs, including electricity and other energy-related costs for our network\\noperations, and transportation and labor costs, as well as increased interest expenses related to rising interest\\nrates. We believe that this inflationary environment and the resulting decline in real wages in the U.S. are\\naltering consumer preferences and causing consumers to become more price conscious. These factors, along with\\nimpacts of the intense competition in our industries, resulted in increased costs and lower earnings per share\\nduring 2022, and caused us to lower our growth expectations and related financial guidance. We expect the\\ninflationary environment and these other pressures to continue into 2023. Although we are taking various measures\\nto improve efficiency and reduce costs, those measures may ultimately be ineffective or insufficient. If the\\neconomic slowdown in the U.S., inflation and other unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, they could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\\n                     \\n  Operational Risks  \\n                     \\nCyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.\\nCyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks,\\nransomware attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to\\nor disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service\\nproviders, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of\\ninformation, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing\\ninformation, as well as disruptions to our or our customers\\u2019 operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including\\nVerizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in\\nconjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The\\ndevelopment and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and\\nupdating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to\\ncyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial\\ncondition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection\\nof our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the\\nfuture.\\n\\nThe inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service\\nproviders as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to\\nVerizon and/or a loss of market share to our competitors. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon\\ncould include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business,\\nincreased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business\\ninterruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizon\\u2019s businesses, such as those offering security solutions\\nand infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if\\n                                                        15                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nour ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Our\\npresence in the IoT industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our\\nexposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these\\nproducts or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information,\\nsuch as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government\\nclaims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact\\ncustomer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon\\u2019s results of operation or\\nfinancial condition.\\nNatural disasters, extreme weather conditions, acts of war, terrorist or other hostile acts could cause damage to\\nour infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.\\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, acts of war, terrorist or other hostile acts,\\nnatural disasters or the potential impacts of climate change, including the increasing prevalence and intensity of\\nhurricanes, wildfires, flooding, hail and storms. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure\\nupon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as\\nwell as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective\\nor inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. We are implementing, and will continue to\\nimplement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future,\\nbut these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These\\nevents could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that\\nwe need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost\\nrevenues from business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.\\nPublic health crises could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an adverse effect\\non our operating results in 2020. Our business is based on our ability to provide products and services to\\ncustomers throughout the United States and around the world and the ability of those customers to use and pay for\\nthose products and services for their businesses and in their daily lives. As a result, our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a public health crisis that\\nsignificantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products and services, the way our\\nemployees are able to provide services to our customers, and the ways that our partners and suppliers are able to\\nprovide products and services to us. For example, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the\\ntransmission of COVID-19 and initiatives Verizon took in response to the health crisis to promote the health and\\nsafety of our employees and provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers, along with the\\nrelated global slowdown in economic activity, resulted in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower earnings\\nper share during 2020. In addition, such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of\\nthe risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances, such as risks associated with our supplier and vendor\\nrelationships, risks of an economic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs and availability of financing.\\nWe depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.\\nWe depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment\\nand services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in\\norder to operate our business and provide products and services to our customers. For example, our smartphone and\\nother device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as\\nchipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network\\ninfrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service\\non a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example,\\ndisruption to the global supply chain as a result of geopolitical factors, public health crises, natural disasters\\nor the potential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we may be unable to provide products and\\nservices as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our\\nnetworks. Due to the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our\\nbusiness could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of\\none or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became\\nnecessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nThe suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we\\ndepend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the\\ncommunications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We\\nexpect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of\\ntechnology.\\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or\\nexperience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 22.5% of our workforce is represented by the Communications Workers of\\nAmerica or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these\\nunions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could\\nadversely affect our business\\n                                                        16                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\noperations. In addition, while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations\\nis represented by unions for bargaining, we cannot predict what impact increased union density in this workforce\\ncould have on our operations.\\n                              \\n  Regulatory and Legal Risks  \\n                              \\nChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results\\nof operations.\\nOur domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, and our\\ninternational operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory\\nregimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide\\nspecified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our\\noperations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental\\nproceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any\\ncertainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the\\nreviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit\\nour ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we\\nwill be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing\\nlicenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal.\\nThe loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nNew laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state, and local, or\\ninternational level, such as those described below, those that incentivize business models or technologies\\ndifferent from ours or requirements limiting our ability to continue or discontinue service to customers could\\nrestrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our businesses, impose\\nadditional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner\\nthat would be attractive to us and our customers.\\n\\n\\u2022 Privacy and data protection \\u2013 We are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data\\nprotection. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy Act, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and a\\nnumber of other privacy laws recently adopted by other states and countries include significant penalties for non-\\ncompliance. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of\\ngovernment globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many\\nlocations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.\\n\\n\\u2022 Regulation of broadband internet access services \\u2013 In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding\\n\\\"light touch\\\" approach to regulating broadband internet access services and \\\"reclassified\\\" these services as\\ntelecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the 2015 Title\\nII Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order\\nhas been affirmed in part by the D.C. Circuit but may be revisited by the FCC or by Congress. Several states have\\nalso adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other\\nrequirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCC\\u2019s 2015 rules). Although some of these\\nhave been challenged in court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain.\\n\\n\\u2022 \\\"Open Access\\\" \\u2013 We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \\\"open access\\\" FCC\\nregulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and\\napplications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC\\nand/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and\\nintroducing new services.\\n\\n\\u2022 Climate-Related Regulation and Policy \\u2013 Due to the nature of our operations, we have been, and expect to continue\\nto be impacted by regulatory developments related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation\\nof greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-\\ndriven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for\\nus to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our\\ncosts associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.\\n\\nThese developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related\\ncourt decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the\\nmarketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.\\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or\\nsettlements.\\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation and claims in arbitration, including, but not limited to,\\nshareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, wage and hour class actions, contract and commercial\\nclaims, personal injury claims, property claims, environmental claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising,\\nsales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful\\ndeath lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones\\n                                                        17                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nor radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may\\nbe required to pay significant awards or settlements.\\n                   \\n  Financial Risks  \\n                   \\nVerizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does\\nnot retire existing debt.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, Verizon had approximately $130.6 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $9.4\\nbillion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and $20.0 billion of outstanding\\nsecured indebtedness. Verizon\\u2019s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences,\\nincluding:\\n\\n\\u2022 requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and\\nother amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as\\nworking capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;\\n\\n\\u2022 making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital,\\ncapital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes and limiting its\\nability to repurchase common stock;\\n\\n\\u2022 reducing Verizon\\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions;\\n\\n\\u2022 making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and\\n\\n\\u2022 exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable\\ninterest rates.\\nAdverse changes in the financial markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability\\nof financing.\\nWe require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part\\nthrough borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the financial markets, including\\nincreases in interest rates or changes in exchange rates, could increase our cost of borrowing, require us to post\\na significant amount of collateral, and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or\\nrefinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is\\nsubject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our\\nborrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies,\\nwhich are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in\\nthese ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing.\\nA severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we\\ndo business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing.\\nIncreases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and\\nincrease our funding commitments.\\nWith approximately 117,100 employees and approximately 186,700 retirees as of December 31, 2022 eligible to\\nparticipate in Verizon\\u2019s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits\\nhave a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding\\nrequirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including increases in healthcare costs, decreases\\nin investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate\\nand mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit\\nfuture increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our\\nfunding commitments.\\n                                         \\n  Item\\u00a01B.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Unresolved Staff Comments  \\n                                         \\nNone.\\n                                                        18                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n                         \\n  Item\\u00a02.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Properties  \\n                         \\nOur principal properties do not lend themselves to simple description by character and location.

With a\\npresence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that\\nare designed to meet customers\\u2019 demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.\\n\\nTo compete effectively in today\\u2019s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our high-performing\\nnetworks to drive growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the digital world. In 2022, we focused\\non maintaining our network leadership, including by rapidly deploying C-Band spectrum; retaining and growing our\\nhigh-quality customer base while balancing profitability in challenging market conditions; and driving monetization\\nof our networks, platforms and solutions. We are creating business value by earning the trust of our stakeholders,\\nlimiting our environmental impact and supporting our customer base growth while creating social benefit through our\\nproducts and services. Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless\\nspectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the\\nfiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced\\ninformation technology systems and data system capabilities. 2022 was a peak year of capital investment for us as\\nwe rapidly deployed C-Band spectrum.

We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell\\ntechnology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity\\nto address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE\\nand 5G networks. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology\\nindustry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher\\nthroughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows our networks to handle more traffic as the\\nnumber of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-Band spectrum, which has been\\nbuilt out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We expect to continue\\ndeploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes available for our\\nuse. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service to run\\nsimultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon\\u2019s\\nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower\\nspectrum bands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current\\nspectrum resources to serve both 4G and 5G customers.\\n\\nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based\\nnetworks supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed\\nconnections is growing. We are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network,\\nproviding improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing\\nservices that will support our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We expect that this new\\narchitecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless\\ntechnology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-efficient manner.\\n                                      \\n  Consolidated Results of Operations  \\n                                      \\nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in\\nour segment results.

The rapid development of new technologies, services and\\nproducts has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long\\ndistance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense\\nas traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share. Our high-quality customer base and\\nnetworks differentiate us from our competitors and give us the ability to plan and manage through changing economic\\nand competitive conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: maintaining a high-\\nquality customer base, delivering strong financial and operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. We\\ncontinue to lead in 4G LTE performance while aggressively building out our 5G network.\\n\\nThe U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new\\nphone connection growth for the industry. We expect future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding\\nexisting customer\\n                                                        35                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nrelationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services and\\nincreasing the penetration of FWA and connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. Although\\ncertain use cases for 5G technologies and related ecosystems are in early development stages, we expect this\\ntechnology will provide a significant opportunity for growth in the coming years. With respect to our wireless\\nconnectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T\\nInc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail\\nactivations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and\\nresell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter\\nCommunications, Inc., and others. We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to\\nincrease their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products\\nand services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet\\nInc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless\\nvoice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as\\nalternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to see increasing competition in the\\nprovisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless\\nofferings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers.\\n\\nWith respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless\\ncompetitive landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they\\nwill regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow,\\nwireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. These service offerings\\nwill vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions and may be provided\\nas standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers. In addition, aggressive device promotions have\\nbecome more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as\\nretaining existing customers.\\n\\nWe expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer demand for\\n5G connectivity continues to expand and customers shift to higher access plans, driven in part by attractive\\nbundled content with premium brands, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue\\ngrowth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways\\nthat our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems. We and other\\nwireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide\\ncustomers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing\\narrangements.\\n\\nCurrent and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies, wireless service\\nproviders, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service\\nproviders, over-the-top providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.\\nWe also face increasing competition from other providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal providers.\\n\\nIn addition, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services. A\\nrelatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve\\ncustomers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with\\nthese providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers.\\nMany of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of\\nwhich contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.\\n\\nDespite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services.\\nWe continue to provide network reliability and offer products, which include fiber-optic internet access, several\\nvideo services, and voice services. Further, we will continue to offer our business and government customers a\\nconverged-enterprise environment for voice and data services as well as more robust IP products and services, and\\nadvance our IoT strategies by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity,\\nplatform and solution layers.\\n\\nWe will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to allow us to have flexibility to adjust to changes in the\\ncompetitive and economic environments and increase shareholder value.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Macroeconomic Environment                                                                                        \\n                                                                                                                   \\nIn 2022, as a result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we experienced increases in our direct costs,\\nincluding electricity and other energy-related costs for our network operations, and transportation and labor\\ncosts, as well as increased interest expenses related to rising interest rates.

Free cash flow is\\ncalculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating\\nactivities. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for\\nongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash\\nflow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on\\nfinance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses.

In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and\\nbetter align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better\\nmatch the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the\\nliability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when\\nliabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the\\nplan and its participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging\\nassets, this strategy will generally result in lower expected asset returns. In 2023, we expect discretionary\\nqualified pension plan contributions to be approximately $200 million and nonqualified pension plan contributions\\nto be insignificant.\\n\\nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred\\nbasis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans.\\nWe contributed $692 million and $885 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively.

We aggregate\\nour wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated\\nbasis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to\\nutilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal,\\nregulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless\\nlicenses.\\n\\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are\\npresent. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to\\nperform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period\\nand proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative\\nimpairment assessment at least every three years.\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test\\nto determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the\\ncarrying amount. As part of our qualitative assessment we considered several factors including the business\\nenterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates\\nand discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results,\\nprojections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our\\ncombined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitative\\nassessment. Our annual impairment test in 2022 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our\\nwireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which indicated that the fair\\nvalue of our wireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in\\nan impairment. Our quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our\\naggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative\\nassessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield\\napproach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow\\ngenerating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless\\nlicenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be\\nwilling to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required\\nto make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability specifically associated with our wireless\\nlicenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows and assumed\\nterminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and\\nexpected availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof\\nas well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows and profitability. The discount rate represented\\nour estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant\\nwould have required as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost\\nof debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly, our discount rate\\nincorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation\\ndate, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation\\ndate. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace\\u2019s long-term growth rate.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Goodwill                                                                                                         \\n                                                                                                                   \\nAt December 31, 2022, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.7 billion, of which $21.1 billion was in\\nour Consumer reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit.\\n\\nTo determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to\\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\\nvalue. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the\\ndetermination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be assessed.\\nIt is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every three years.\\n\\nUnder the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise value of the\\nreporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test,\\nmacroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market\\nconsiderations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition\\nactivity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.\\n\\nUnder the quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a\\ndiscounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach. The market approach includes the use of comparative\\nmultiples to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value\\nof two components-projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized\\nfuture cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value\\nof the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete\\nperiod and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or\\nexpected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of\\nour goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model.\\n                                                        44                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThe discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect\\nrisk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to\\nhistory and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment\\ninvolved in the selection of comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies and\\nmultiples was influenced by differences in growth and profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer\\ncompanies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in one or a combination of these\\ninputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting\\nunit. Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer\\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting\\nunit given it has continued to experience increased market pressures resulting in lower than expected revenues and\\nearnings that may continue to persist over the near term. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October\\n31, 2022, our Business reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 8% and,\\ntherefore, did not result in an impairment. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to\\nchange the outcome of the quantitative impairment assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth\\nrate declined by 50 basis points, or if the discount rate increased by 50 basis points, the fair value of our\\nBusiness reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. However, as a result of our 2022 goodwill\\nassessment, management believes there is an increasing risk that our Business reporting unit may be required to\\nrecognize an impairment charge in the future. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional\\ninformation.\\n\\nA projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact\\non its fair value and may result in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1)\\ndecreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2)\\nthe inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to\\nmacroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value\\nof the reporting unit.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.6 billion, of which $21.0 billion was in\\nour Consumer reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit. We performed quantitative\\nimpairment assessments for both our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2021. At the\\ngoodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2021, our quantitative assessments indicated that the fair\\nvalues for our Consumer and Business reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and,\\ntherefore, did not result in impairment.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans                                                                   \\n                                                                                                                   \\nWe maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other\\npostretirement benefit plans.

The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the\\nindividual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed\\nincome corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each\\nfuture cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.\\n\\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Income Taxes                                                                                                     \\n                                                                                                                   \\nOur current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions\\narising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards,\\nchanges in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items.

The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom\\ncredit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-\\naverage loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The weighted-average expected loss rate increased\\n0.44% at December 31, 2022 as compared to at December 31, 2021. We expect that an increase or decrease of 0.25% in\\nthe weighted-average loss rate would result in a change of $111 million in the allowance.\\n\\nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables\\nare disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global\\nenterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and\\nmedium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance\\nmultiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the\\ncontractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions\\nbased on management\\u2019s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline\\nreceivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer\\ncredit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.\\n\\nIf there is a deterioration of our customers\\u2019 financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables\\nin general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which\\nwould affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.

We believe these spectrum\\nlicense transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also\\nresulting in a more efficient use of spectrum.\\n\\nIn March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47\\nGHz bands concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses,\\nwhich primarily consisted of 37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz\\nlicenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the\\nauction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon amounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was settled with\\nthe relinquished 39 GHz licenses.\\n\\nIn February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the\\nlicenses it won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules\\napplicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments\\nare for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license\\nholders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be $7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3\\nbillion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. During 2022, we made additional\\npayments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing costs. We expect\\nto continue to make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024, which we\\nexpect to be $4.8 billion. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of\\nthe spectrum for Verizon\\u2019s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent\\nholders\\u2019 execution of their clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by\\nDecember 2025. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to\\nparticipate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon\\u2019s allocable share of clearing costs incurred\\nby, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated\\nto pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have\\noccurred.\\n\\nIn March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band\\nspectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022,\\nVerizon incurred costs associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which $310 million was\\npaid as of the year ended December 31, 2022.

We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of\\nderivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest\\nrate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\\n\\nIt is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to\\nthe extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our\\nobjectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable\\nrisk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market\\nconditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of\\nchanges in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.\\n\\nCounterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated\\nderivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for\\ncollateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be\\nrequired to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established\\nthresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments\\nand fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or\\n                                                        48                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nthe obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December\\n31, 2022, we did not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2022, we posted $2.3 billion of collateral related to\\nderivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, we held and posted $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount,\\nrespectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were\\nrecorded as Other current liabilities and Prepaid expenses and other, respectively, in our consolidated balance\\nsheet. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the\\nrisk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of\\noperations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio.\\n                      \\n  Interest Rate Risk  \\n                      \\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt\\nthat carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 74% of the aggregate principal amount\\nof our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed-rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap\\nagreements designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating\\nrate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are\\ndesignated as hedges, of approximately $420 million. The interest rates on our existing long-term debt obligations\\nare unaffected by changes to our credit ratings.\\n\\nCertain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates\\nthat are linked to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. The U.S. dollar LIBOR rates\\nutilized in these transactions will cease publication after June 30, 2023, in accordance with recent U.S. and\\ninternational regulatory guidance for reform. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted\\nbut could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative\\ntransactions. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position given our current mix of variable\\nand fixed-rate debt and taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging. In 2021, we began utilizing\\ninterest rates that are linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the benchmark rate for various floating\\nrate transactions.\\n\\nThe table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest\\nrate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

We\\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\nA company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting\\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\\nthe company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\\nor procedures may deteriorate.\\n                             \\n  /s/    Ernst & Young LLP   \\n         Ernst\\u00a0& Young LLP   \\n         New York, New York  \\n         February 10, 2023   \\n                             \\n                                                        51                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n                                                      \\n  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting  \\n  Firm                                                \\n                                                      \\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.:\\n                                                                                                                   \\n  Opinion on the Financial Statements                                                                              \\n                                                                                                                   \\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries\\n(Verizon or the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income,\\ncomprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December\\n31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)\\n(collectively referred to as the \\\"consolidated financial statements\\\").

(the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with\\nthe Company, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world\\u2019s leading providers of communications, technology,\\ninformation and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a\\npresence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that\\nare designed to meet customers\\u2019 demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.\\nWe have tworeportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group\\n(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).\\nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our\\nwireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under\\nthe Verizon brand, TracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone) brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also\\nprovide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in\\nnine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic\\nnetwork through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are\\nnot served by Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail\\ncustomers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.\\nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and\\nconferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long\\ndistance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We\\nalso provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses,\\ngovernment customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to\\ncustomers around the world.\\nConsolidation\\nThe method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all\\nsignificant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the\\noperations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as\\nvariable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries\\nthat are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity. Investments in\\nbusinesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and\\nfinancial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in\\nInvestments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts\\nand transactions have been eliminated.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires\\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and\\nassumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable,\\nincluding but not limited to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related economic\\nimplications. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\\nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets,\\nproperty, plant and equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability,\\nfair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and\\nintangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement\\nbenefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\\nin connection with business combinations.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other\\nservices and through the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and\\nconnectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to\\nprovide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large\\nenterprises and government customers. We account for these revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\\n2014-09, \\\"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\\\" (Topic 606).\\n                                                        59                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for\\ntowers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the\\ninterest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized\\nagent.\\nNature of Products and Services\\n\\nTelecommunications\\n\\nService\\nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we\\nrecognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses,\\nbecause it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to\\nthe customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for\\nadditional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents\\noptions held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer\\nexercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\\n\\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for\\nservice are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized\\nover the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes\\nthe benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service\\nrevenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in\\namount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\\nEquipment\\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally\\nrecognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the\\ncustomer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have twoprimary offerings through\\nwhich customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device\\npayment plans.\\n\\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted\\nprice in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24months or less).\\n\\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing\\ninstallment note, which is repaid by the customer, typically over a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a\\nmonth-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied\\nover a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the\\ntransaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are\\nrecognized when earned.\\n\\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the\\npayment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance\\nobligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess,\\nat the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment\\nplan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our customer classes. These\\nconsiderations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing\\nprovided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which\\nimpact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that\\nthe financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct\\nchannel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on\\nthe interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized\\nagent in our indirect channel.\\nWireless Contracts\\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and\\nwireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling\\nprices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding\\nsubsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the\\nprice that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty\\n(i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a\\nwireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable\\nrights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early\\nterminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is\\ncanceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our\\ndetermination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the\\nright to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and\\ntrading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The\\nfull amount of the trade-in right's fair value\\n                                                        60                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nis recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the\\ndevice. The guarantee liability was $ 54million and $ 77million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The\\ntotal transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside the scope of Topic 606, and the\\nremaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.\\n\\nOur fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the\\ncreation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the recognition of equipment revenue in excess\\nof amounts billed.\\n\\nFor our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are\\nincluded in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability.\\n\\nWe may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights\\nare accounted for as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize\\nrevenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns\\nand credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional\\ninformation becomes available. We also may provide credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts\\nwith resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to\\nrecognize.\\nWireline Contracts\\nTotal consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each performance\\nobligation based on our standalone selling price for each service. While many contracts include one or more service\\nperformance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the\\nservices are generally satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the\\nprice of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional discount. In addition, we also assess\\nwhether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with\\ncustomers such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The\\nassessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of\\ntransaction price and related disclosures.\\n\\nWe may provide performance-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with our Business\\ncustomers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are\\nestimated at contract inception and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information\\nbecomes available.\\nWireless and Wireline Contracts\\nFor offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or as the agent\\nwith respect to the goods or services provided to the customer. This principal-versus-agent assessment involves\\njudgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the arrangement indicate that the goods or services\\nwere controlled by us prior to transferring them to the customer. To evaluate if we have control, we consider\\nvarious factors including whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have\\ndiscretion over pricing.\\nOther\\nAdvertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue\\nis generated by the display of graphical advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising\\nrevenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on the search results page. The divested\\nVerizon Media Group (Verizon Media), primarily earned revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media\\nproperties, as well as on third-party properties through our advertising platforms, search advertising, and\\nsubscription arrangements. Revenue for display and search advertising contracts is recognized as ads are delivered,\\nwhile subscription contracts are recognized over time. We are generally the principal in transactions carried out\\nthrough our advertising platforms, and therefore report gross revenue based on the amount billed to our customers.\\nThe control and transfer of digital advertising inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, where our\\nproprietary technology enables us to identify, enhance, verify and solely control digital advertising inventory\\nthat we then sell to our customers. Our control is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our\\ncustomers for fulfillment and the fact that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing. We completed the\\nsale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media.\\n\\nWe offer telematics services including smart fleet management and optimization software. Telematics service revenue\\nis generated primarily through subscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription\\ncontracts.\\n\\nWe report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on\\na net basis.\\nMaintenance and Repairs\\nWe charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting\\nsubstantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs are incurred.\\n                                                        61                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\nAdvertising Costs\\nCosts for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to\\nSelling, general and administrative expense in the periods in which they are incurred.See Note 15 for additional\\ninformation.\\nEarnings Per Common Share\\nBasic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period.\\nWhere appropriate, diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of shares issuable under our\\nstock-based compensation plans.\\nThere were a total of approximately 1.9million, 1.7million and 2.0million outstanding dilutive securities,\\nprimarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share\\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022 , 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash\\nequivalents.

For investments in equity securities without readily determinable\\nfair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative permitted under GAAP to measure these investments at cost,\\nless any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an\\nidentical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in debt securities without quoted prices,\\nVerizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in\\nconsolidation of the investee are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are\\nincluded in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nAccounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be\\nrecovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented\\nseparately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected\\nfailure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at\\ninception and reassess quarterly based on management\\u2019s expectation of the asset\\u2019s collectability. The allowance is\\nbased on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base,\\nthe aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as\\nmanagement\\u2019s expectations of conditions in the future, as applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on\\nmanagement\\u2019s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics.\\nWe pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared risk\\ncharacteristics of \\\"new customers\\\" and \\\"existing customers.\\\" New customers are defined as customers who have been\\nwith Verizon for less than 210days. Existing customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for\\n210days or more. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible.\\nFor device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation\\nusing our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other\\nqualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the\\ncustom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the\\nweighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance.\\n                                                        62                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables\\nare disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global\\nenterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and\\nmedium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance\\nmultiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the\\ncontractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions\\nbased on management\\u2019s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline\\nreceivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer\\ncredit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.\\nInventories\\nInventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost\\n(determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value.\\nPlant and Depreciation\\nWe record property, plant and equipment at cost. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a\\nstraight-line basis.\\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining\\nterm of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset was placed in service.\\nWhen depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are\\ndeducted from the property, plant and equipment accounts and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in\\nSelling, general and administrative expense.\\nWe capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed within property, plant and equipment assets.\\nWe also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized\\ninterest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related\\nassets.\\nComputer Software and Cloud Computing Costs\\nWe capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and defer the costs associated with cloud\\ncomputing arrangements that have a useful life and term in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications\\nor upgrades to internal-use network and non-network software are capitalized only to the extent that they add\\nsignificant new functionality. Planning, software maintenance and training costs for internal-use software and\\ncloud computing arrangements are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. We capitalize interest\\nassociated with the development of internal-use network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-\\nuse software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 7years and are included in Other\\nintangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred in implementing a cloud computing\\narrangement are deferred during the application-development stage and recorded as Prepaid expense and other in our\\nconsolidated balance sheets. Once a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, we stop\\ndeferring the related cloud computing arrangement costs.\\nFor a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized non-network software costs, see \\\"Goodwill and Other\\nIntangible Assets\\\" below. See Note 4 for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in\\nour consolidated balance sheets. Similar to capitalized software costs, deferred costs associated with cloud\\ncomputing arrangements are subject to impairment testing.\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets\\nacquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if\\nimpairment indicators are present.\\nTo determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However,\\nwe may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications\\nof a potential impairment exist. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every\\nthree years.\\nUnder the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise value of the\\nreporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test,\\nmacroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market\\nconsiderations (including industry revenue and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\\n(EBITDA) margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected\\nfinancial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.\\nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and compares the fair value\\nof the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a\\nform of the income\\n                                                        63                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\napproach) to its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value\\nhierarchy, see \\\"Fair Value Measurements\\\" discussion below for additional information. The market approach includes\\nthe use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted\\ncash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a terminal value. The\\nterminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows\\nfrom the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the\\npresent value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount\\nrate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace\\nparticipant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an\\nimpairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill\\nof that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for\\neach of our reporting units. Those plans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future\\noperating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.\\n\\nSee Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.\\nIntangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\\nA significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the\\nexclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While\\nlicenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by\\nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost.\\nMoreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or\\nother factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as\\nan indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year\\nto determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our\\nwireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as\\npart of our nationwide wireless network.\\n\\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are\\npresent. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to\\nperform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period\\nand proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative\\nimpairment assessment at least every three years.\\n\\nAs part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the business enterprise value of our\\ncombined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates),\\nindustry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent\\nmerger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business\\nas a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitative assessment. See Note 4 for\\nadditional information regarding our impairment tests.\\n\\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless\\nlicenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the\\nfair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based\\nvaluation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a\\nhypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A\\ndiscounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to\\npurchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated\\nwireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge\\nis recognized.\\n\\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended\\nuse is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is\\ndiscontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\\n\\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate\\nin these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until\\nthe corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated\\nstatements of cash flows.\\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use\\nsoftware) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of our intangible assets subject to amortization and\\nother long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\\ncarrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test\\nfor recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected\\nto be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we\\nwould perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We\\nre-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and\\ncircumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\\n                                                        64                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible\\nassets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\\nLeases\\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity\\nmediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both\\noperating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For\\narrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately, we determine the\\nclassification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement\\ndate, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.\\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the\\nunderlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents the present value of our obligation to\\nmake payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the\\nincremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a\\nportfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to\\nthe lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured borrowing rate and\\nrisk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis.\\nIn those circumstances where Verizon is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated with our leases\\n(e.g., common area maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our\\nasset classes. Additionally, in arrangements where we are the lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which\\nwe account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the\\nrevenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the\\narrangements.\\nRent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included\\nin either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income,\\nbased on the use of the facility or equipment on which rent is being paid. Variable rent payments related to both\\noperating and finance leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of payments\\ndependent on various external indicators, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utility\\nusage.\\nOperating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets; we recognize\\nrent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nWe recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the\\nshorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset in Depreciation and amortization expense in\\nour consolidated statements of income. The interest expense related to finance leases is recognized using the\\neffective interest method based on the discount rate determined at lease commencement and is included within\\nInterest expense in our consolidated statements of income.\\nSee Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under ASU 2016-02, Leases\\n(Topic 842).\\nFair Value Measurements\\nFair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the\\namount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\\nmarket participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs\\nused in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:\\nLevel 1 \\u2014 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\\nLevel 2 \\u2014 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\\nLevel 3 \\u2014 Unobservable pricing inputs in the market\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that\\nis significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair\\nvalue measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and\\ntheir categorization within the fair value hierarchy.\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning\\nstrategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\\nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income\\ntax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in\\nwhich those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to\\nreduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\\n                                                        65                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax\\nreturn. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be\\nsustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the\\ntechnical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition\\nthreshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full\\nknowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-\\nthan-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial\\nstatements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being\\nrealized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized\\nin the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for\\nincome taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an\\nincrease in a deferred tax liability.\\n\\nSignificant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax\\nrate.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and\\ndirectors based on estimated fair values.See Note 10 for additional information.\\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\\nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we\\ntranslate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income\\nstatement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities. We record these translation\\nadjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of Equity, in our consolidated balance\\nsheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional\\ncurrency as a component of Other income (expense), net.\\nEmployee Benefit Plans\\nPension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on\\nprojected benefit obligations, are accrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits\\nare generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.\\nExpected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value\\nof plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in which they\\noccur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon\\nmanagement employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy.\\nSee Note 11 for additional information.\\nWe recognize a pension or a postretirement plan\\u2019s funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a\\ncomponent of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income tax.\\nDerivative Instruments\\nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\\nrates and interest rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of\\nderivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury\\nrate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading\\npurposes.\\nWe measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market\\nparameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the\\nfair values of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period.\\nFor fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along\\nwith the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Unrealized gains or losses on excluded components of fair\\nvalue hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized into earnings on a systematic and\\nrational basis through the swap accrual over the life of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the\\nfair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in\\nearnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of certain of our foreign\\noperations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income\\n(loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency\\nchanges on the value of our net investment.\\nCash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented\\nconsistently with the cash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nVIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional\\nsubordinated financial support from other parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make\\nsignificant decisions relating to the entity\\u2019s\\n                                                        66                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\noperations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the\\nright to receive the residual returns of the entity.

The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions\\nthat most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the\\nright to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) using the modified\\nretrospective approach.

Revenue and Contract Costs  \\n                                      \\nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other\\nservices and through the sale of wireless equipment.\\nRevenue by Category\\nWe have tworeportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units, Consumer and Business.\\nRevenue is disaggregated by products and services within Consumer, and customer groups (Small and Medium Business,\\nGlobal Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale) within Business. See Note 13 for additional information\\non revenue by segment. Corporate and other primarily includes insurance captive revenues as well as the historical\\nresults of divested businesses, including Verizon Media.\\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for\\ntowers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the\\ninterest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized\\nagent. As allowed by the practical expedient within Topic 842, we have elected to combine the lease and non-lease\\ncomponents for those arrangements of customer premise equipment where we are the lessor as components accounted for\\nunder Topic 606. Revenues from arrangements that were not accounted for under Topic 606 were approximately $\\n3.2billion, $ 3.1billion and $ 2.9billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\nRemaining Performance Obligations\\nWhen allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total\\ntransaction price may relate to service performance obligations which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied\\nas of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose information relating to these unsatisfied performance\\nobligations. We apply the practical expedient available under Topic 606 that provides the option to exclude the\\nexpected revenues arising from unsatisfied performance obligations related to contracts that have an original\\nexpected duration of one year or less. This situation primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month\\nservice contracts. At December 31, 2022, month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 94% of our\\nwireless postpaid contracts and 92% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts, compared to\\nDecember 31, 2021, for which month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 93% of our wireless\\npostpaid contracts and 86% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts .\\nAdditionally, certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fees related to\\nthese additional services are recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month\\nbasis).\\nContracts for wireless services, with or without promotional credits that require maintenance of service, are\\ngenerally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time, or considered to contain terms ranging from greater\\nthan one monthto up to thirty-six months(typically under a device payment plan), or contain terms ranging from\\ngreater than one monthto up to twenty-four months(typically under a fixed-term plan). Additionally, customers may\\nincur charges based on usage or additional optional services purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract\\nthat can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. The transaction price\\nallocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of\\nthe reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not accounted for as month-to-month contracts.\\nOur Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wireless service\\nunder their own brands to their respective customers. Reseller arrangements generally include a stated contract\\nterm, which typically\\n                                                        67                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nextends longer than two yearsand, in some cases, include a periodic minimum revenue commitment over the contract\\nterm for which revenues will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nConsumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-month; however, they may have a service\\nterm of two yearsor shorter than twelve months. Certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services\\nextend into future periods, contain fixed monthly fees and usage-based fees, and can include annual commitments in\\neach year of the contract or commitments over the entire specified contract term; however, a significant number of\\ncontracts for wireline services with our Business customers have a contract term that is twelve monthsor less.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline and telematics services that have a\\ncontractual minimum fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be\\nrecognized related to those contracts; thus, they are excluded from the time bands below. These contracts have\\nvarying terms spanning over approximately nine yearsending in April 2032 and have aggregate contract minimum\\npayments totaling $ 1.6billion.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are expected to be\\nrecognized for 2023, 2024 and thereafter was $ 22.1billion, $ 14.3billion and $ 8.1billion, respectively. Remaining\\nperformance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations\\nand changes in the timing and scope of contracts, arising from contract modifications.\\nAccounts Receivable and Contract Balances\\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in\\nour consolidated balance sheets represent an unconditional right to consideration. Contract balances represent\\namounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by transferring goods or services to the customer in\\nadvance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services from the customer, or the customer\\nhas made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control of the goods and/or services promised to the customer\\nin the contract.\\nThe following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers:\\n                                                                                                                   \\n                                        At December\\u00a031,               At December\\u00a031,               At January 1,  \\n  (dollars in millions)                 2022                          2021                          2021           \\n \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 \\n  Receivables(1)             $  11,274                     $  10,758                     $  12,029                 \\n  Device payment plan                                                                                              \\n  agreement                     16,648                        12,888                        10,358                 \\n  receivables(2)                                                                                                   \\n                                                                                                                   \\n(1) Balances do not include receivables related to the following contracts: leasing arrangements (such as those for\\ntowers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the\\ninterest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized\\nagent.\\n(2) Included in device payment plan agreement receivables presented in Note 8.

Under a fixed-term plan, total contract revenue\\nis allocated between wireless service and equipment revenues. In conjunction with these arrangements, a contract\\nasset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and\\nthe amount of consideration received from the customer when the performance obligation related to the transfer of\\ncontrol of the equipment is satisfied. The contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless\\nservices are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which\\nresults in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our\\nconsolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize the allowance for credit\\nlosses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability.\\n\\nContract assets remained relatively flat during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\n\\nContract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods\\nor services promised in the contract. We typically bill service one month in advance, which is the primary\\ncomponent of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are\\nprovided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other\\ncurrent liabilities and Other liabilities.\\n\\nContract liabilities increased $ 1.0billion during the year ended December 31, 2022.

We recognize an\\nasset for incremental commission expenses paid to internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction\\nwith obtaining customer contracts. We only defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are\\nincremental costs that would not have been incurred absent the customer contract and are expected to be\\nrecoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period\\nrepresenting the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain wireless contracts are\\namortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated device upgrade cycles, as such costs are\\ntypically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over\\nthe estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to obtain wireline\\ncontracts for our Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in Selling, general\\nand administrative expense.\\n\\nWe also defer costs incurred to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to\\ngenerate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected\\nto be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy\\nour performance obligations and recorded in Cost of services. These costs principally relate to direct costs that\\nenhance our wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to install circuits.\\n\\nWe determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a\\nportfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract portfolios.\\n\\nOther costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred.\\n\\nCollectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract\\ncosts, and amortized over a two-to six-yearperiod. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current\\nwithin Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively.\\nThe balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:\\n                                                                                        \\n  (dollars\\u00a0in\\u00a0millions)                   At December\\u00a031,              At December\\u00a031,  \\n  Assets                                  2022                         2021             \\n \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 \\n  Prepaid expenses and other    $  2,629                     $  2,432                   \\n  Other assets                     2,475                        2,259                   \\n  Total                         $  5,104                     $  4,691                   \\n                                                                                        \\nFor both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized expense of $ 3.0billion associated with the\\namortization of deferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our\\nconsolidated statements of income.\\n\\nWe assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis.

Acquisitions and Divestitures  \\n                                         \\nSpectrum License Transactions\\nIn March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47\\nGHz bands concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940licenses, which\\nprimarily consisted of 37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz\\nlicenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the\\nauction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon amounted to $ 3.4billion, of which $ 1.8billion was settled with\\nthe relinquished 39 GHz licenses. The remaining balance was settled in cash of $ 1.6billion. In connection with the\\nincentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $ 1.2billion ($ 914million after-tax) was recorded in Selling, general and\\nadministrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the exchange of the previously\\nheld licenses for new licenses had commercial substance.\\nIn February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $ 45.5billion for the\\nlicenses it won, of which $ 44.6billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules\\napplicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments\\nare for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license\\nholders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be $ 7.7billion. During 2021, we made payments of $\\n1.3billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. During 2022, we made additional\\npayments of $ 1.6billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing costs, of which $\\n1.4billion were accrued as of December 31, 2021 in our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to continue to make\\npayments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024, which we expect to be $\\n4.8billion. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the spectrum for\\nVerizon\\u2019s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders\\u2019 execution\\nof their clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The\\ncarrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and\\npurchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon\\u2019s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive\\npayments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to\\nacquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred.\\nIn March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band\\nspectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022,\\nVerizon incurred costs associated with these agreements of approximately $ 340million, of which $ 310million was\\npaid as of December 31, 2022. This early clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key\\nmarkets to support its fifth-generation (5G) network initiatives.\\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash\\nconsideration of an insignificant amount and $ 95million, respectively. During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax loss\\nin connection with the sale of certain wireless licenses of $ 223million ($ 167million after tax).\\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\\nTracFone Wireless, Inc.\\nIn September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (TracFone Purchase Agreement) with Am\\u00e9rica M\\u00f3vil to acquire\\nTracFone, a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November\\n23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date). The acquisition positions Verizon as the leading prepaid, value and premium\\nwireless carrier by expanding Verizon\\u2019s portfolio, bringing enhanced access of our wireless network and\\ncomprehensive suite of mobility products and services to a new customer base.\\nIn accordance with the terms of the TracFone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of TracFone's outstanding\\nstock in exchange for approximately $ 3.5billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other\\nadjustments, 57,596,544shares of our common stock valued at approximately $ 3.0billion, and up to an additional $\\n650million in future cash contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and\\nother commercial arrangements. The fair value of the common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market\\nprice on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date\\nwas approximately $ 560million and represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements\\nand Disclosures. See Note 9 for additional information. The contingent consideration payable is based on the\\nachievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-yearearn out period, as defined in the\\nTracFone Purchase Agreement.\\nIn May 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $ 248million for the final settlement of working capital, which\\nwas included in our consideration as of the Acquisition Date. During 2022, Verizon made payments of $ 188million\\nrelated to the contingent consideration, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our\\nconsolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The most significant adjustments related to goodwill, deferred income taxes, deferred commission\\ncosts and other intangible assets.\\nDuring 2022, we recorded a measurement period adjustment resulting in changes to the fair value and amortization\\nperiod of certain intangible assets. As such, we recorded an adjustment to the fair value of certain intangible\\nassets with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. As a result of the changes in the provisional fair value and\\namortization period of certain intangible assets during the one-year measurement period, amortization expense\\ndecreased $ 110million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other intangible assets include $ 2.4billion related\\nto customer relationships, with a weighted-average amortization period of 7years, $ 1.1billion related to\\ndistribution relationships, with an amortization period of 5years, $ 740million related to trade names with a\\nweighted-average amortization period of 17years and $ 145million related to acquired technology, with an\\namortization period of 10years. The intangible assets were assigned fair values using an income approach. The\\nvaluations are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant inputs not observable in\\nthe market, which include the discount rate, royalty rate and amount and timing of future cash flows.\\n\\nGoodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration paid and\\npayable and the fair value of the net assets acquired, representing future economic benefits that we expect to\\nachieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill related to this acquisition is included within the Consumer\\nsegment.\\n\\nPursuant to the TracFone Purchase Agreement, Am\\u00e9rica M\\u00f3vil agreed to indemnify Verizon against certain pre-\\nacquisition tax matters and other contingencies. We have recorded total contingent liabilities and offsetting\\nindemnification assets of $ 672million for the expected reimbursement of these matters that had not been resolved\\nas of the Acquisition Date. The liabilities are presented in Other liabilities and the indemnification assets are\\npresented in Other assets, within our consolidated balance sheets. The amounts recognized represent reasonable\\nestimates based on an evaluation of current facts and circumstances. Actual outcome may differ significantly from\\nthese estimates. We expect that any additional liabilities that may arise related to these indemnified matters\\nwould be indemnified and reimbursed by Am\\u00e9rica M\\u00f3vil.\\nBluegrass Cellular\\nIn October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular, a rural\\nwireless operator serving central Kentucky.

See Note 1 for additional information.\\nAs discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if\\nimpairment indicators are present. In 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment, which indicated it\\nwas more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying amount and,\\ntherefore, did not result in an impairment. In 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment test, which compared\\nthe estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses, estimated using the Greenfield approach, to the\\naggregated carrying amount of the licenses as of the test date. Our annual assessment in 2021 indicated that the\\nfair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\\n                                                        72                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nOur strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into\\nservice, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses,\\nevolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and\\ndata system capabilities.\\nGoodwill\\nChanges in the carrying amount of Goodwill are as follows:\\n                                                                                                                   \\n                                                                                               (dollars in         \\n                                                                                               millions)           \\n                                 Consumer              Business            Other               Total               \\n \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 \\n  Balance at                                                                                                       \\n  January 1,          $  17,222              $  7,535              $   16           $  24,773                      \\n  2021(1)                                                                                                          \\n  Acquisitions(2)         3,818                     \\u2014                  34               3,852                      \\n  Reclassificatio\\u2026                                                                                                 \\n  adjustments and             2                   -20                  -4                 -22                      \\n  other                                                                                                            \\n  Balance at                                                                                                       \\n  December 31,           21,042                 7,515                  46              28,603                      \\n  2021                                                                                                             \\n  Acquisitions(3)           100                     \\u2014                   \\u2014                 100                      \\n  Reclassificatio\\u2026                                                                                                 \\n  adjustments and             \\u2014                   -13                 -19                 -32                      \\n  other(4)                                                                                                         \\n  Balance at                                                                                                       \\n  December 31,        $  21,142              $  7,502              $   27           $  28,671                      \\n  2022                                                                                                             \\n                                                                                                                   \\n(1) Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment charges of $ 4.8billion, related to our historical Media reporting\\nunit, which included Verizon Media.

We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income\\napproach, reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected\\ngrowth rates, which indicated that the fair value of our Business reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and,\\ntherefore, did not result in an impairment. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to\\nchange the outcome of the quantitative impairment assessment. However, as a result of our 2022 goodwill assessment,\\nmanagement believes there is an increasing risk that our Business reporting unit may be required to recognize an\\nimpairment charge in the future.\\n\\nA projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative\\nimpact on its fair value and may result in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other\\nthings: (1) decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other\\nfactors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives.

Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1year to 30years, some of which include\\noptions that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25years, and some of which include options to\\nterminate the leases.

We include\\noptions to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\\nDuring March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which\\nAmerican Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300of our wireless towers for an\\nupfront payment of\\n                                                        74                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\n$ 5.0billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10years at current\\nmarket rates in 2015, with options to renew.

As of December 31,\\n2022, we had noshort-term borrowing outstanding.\\n\\nIn 2022, we issued $ 27.4billion in commercial paper and we repaid $ 27.3billion of commercial paper. As of\\nDecember 31, 2022, we had $ 150million of commercial paper outstanding. These transactions are reflected within\\nCash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\nAsset-Backed Debt\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $ 20.0billion. Our asset-backed debt\\nincludes Asset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing\\nFacilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively, the Banks). Our consolidated asset-\\nbacked debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively, the ABS Entities) issue the debt\\nor are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in\\n                                                        78                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nconnection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership\\n(Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain other Company affiliates (collectively, the\\nOriginators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables and certain other receivables (collectively\\nreferred to as certain receivables) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another\\nABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities retain the equity interests and residual interests, as\\napplicable, in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on\\nthe asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses.\\n\\nOur asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and future collections on such receivables. These\\nreceivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only\\nbe available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect\\nof additional transfers of certain receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed debt\\ntransactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon\\u2019s creditors until the\\nassociated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold\\nour asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon\\nwith respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt.

When a customer enters into a device payment plan\\nagreement with the right to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation.\\nWe recognize a liability measured at fair value for the customer\\u2019s right to trade in the device which is determined\\nby considering several factors, including the weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar\\ndevices eligible for trade-in. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the amount of the guarantee liability\\nwas $ 54million and $ 77million, respectively.\\n\\nWe may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the\\npurchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions, the customer receives a credit for the value of the\\ntrade-in device. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the amount of trade-in liability was $ 562million and\\n$ 366million, respectively.\\n\\nIn addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied against the\\ncustomer\\u2019s monthly bill as long as service is maintained. These future billing credits are accounted for as\\nconsideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in\\na contract liability.\\n\\nDevice payment plan agreement receivables, net, does not reflect the trade-in liability, additional future credits\\nor the guarantee liability.\\nOrigination of Device Payment Plan Agreements\\nWhen originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk\\nscore to measure the credit quality of a customer and to determine eligibility for the device payment program.\\nVerizon\\u2019s experience has been that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for\\nestimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk\\ncharacteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend\\nto perform better than receivables from customers that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of\\nthis experience, we make initial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are \\\"established customers\\\" or\\n\\\"short-tenured customers.\\\" If a Consumer customer has been a customer for 45days\\n                                                        83                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nor more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12months or more, the customer is considered an\\n\\\"established customer.\\\" For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely\\non a combination of internal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than\\n45days, or a Business customer has been a customer for less than 12months, the customer is considered a \\\"short-\\ntenured customer.\\\" For short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit monitoring processes rely more\\nheavily on external data sources.\\n\\nAvailable external credit data from credit reporting agencies along with internal data are used to create custom\\ncredit risk scores for Consumer customers. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the\\napplicant\\u2019s credit data using proprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that\\nthe potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of\\nshort-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit report is not available from one of the national credit\\nreporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history. In those instances,\\nalternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify the existence of\\nthe business with external data sources.\\n\\nBased on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers\\nof credit.

The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other\\nqualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the\\ncustom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the\\nweighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance.\\n\\nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables\\nare disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global\\nenterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and\\nmedium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance\\nmultiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the\\ncontractual life of the receivables and is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current and future\\nconditions based on management\\u2019s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale\\nwireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual\\ncustomer credit risk, if applicable.\\n                                                        84                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment of receivables was as follows:\\n                                                                                                                  \\n                                                                Device Payment             Wireless Service Plan  \\n  (dollars in millions)                          Plan Agreement Receivables(1)             Receivables            \\n \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 \\n  Balance at January\\u00a01, 2022                  $                            759    $   130                         \\n  Current period provision for expected                                    958        428                         \\n  credit losses                                                                                                   \\n  Write-offs charged against the allowance                                -869       -463                         \\n  Recoveries collected                                                      33         48                         \\n  Balance at December\\u00a031, 2022                $                            881    $   143                         \\n                                                                                                                  \\n(1) Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables.\\nWe monitor delinquency and write-off experience based on the quality of our device payment plan agreement and\\nwireless service receivables portfolios. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer\\nare based on the results of our proprietary custom internal scoring models that analyze the customer\\u2019s past\\nperformance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These custom scoring models\\nassess a number of variables, including origination characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns.\\nSince our customers\\u2019 behaviors may be impacted by general economic conditions, we analyzed whether changes in\\nmacroeconomic conditions impact our credit loss experience and have concluded that our credit loss estimates are\\ngenerally not materially impacted by reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Based on\\nthe score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the collection strategy to\\nbe applied to such accounts. For device payment plan agreement receivables and wireless service receivables, we\\nconsider an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are unpaid charges remaining on the account on\\nthe day after the bill\\u2019s due date.

Such investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable\\nprice changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are included in\\nInvestments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and December\\n31, 2021, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values was $ 804million and $\\n808million, respectively. During 2022, there were insignificant adjustments due to observable price changes and\\ninsignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment charges\\nwere approximately $ 176million and $ 82million, respectively.\\n\\nVerizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of TracFone, completed in November\\n2021. The fair value is calculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and represents a Level 3\\nmeasurement. Level 3 instruments include valuation based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions,\\nconsistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. Subsequent to the Acquisition\\nDate, at each reporting date, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair value. During 2022, we\\nrecorded gains of $ 57million related to fair value adjustments for the contingent consideration within Selling,\\ngeneral and administrative expensein our consolidated statement of income. During 2022, we made payments of $\\n188million related to the contingent consideration. In January 2023, we made an additional payment of $ 102million\\nrelated to the contingent consideration. See Note 3 for additional information.\\n\\nFixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income\\nsecurities is based on the quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive\\nmarkets or models that apply inputs from observable market data. The valuation determines that these securities are\\nclassified as Level 2.\\n\\nDerivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial\\nterms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified within Level 2.

We principally receive\\nfixed rates and pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are\\ndesignated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. We\\nrecord the interest rate swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes\\nin the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded to Interest expense, which are primarily offset by\\nchanges in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.\\n\\nCross Currency Swaps\\nWe have entered into cross currency swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges through March 31, 2022 to\\nexchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash\\nflows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign\\ncurrency transaction gains or losses. A portion of the loss recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) was\\nreclassified to Interest expense to offset the related pre-tax foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the\\nunderlying hedged item.\\n\\nOn March 31, 2022, we elected to de-designate our cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges and re-designated these\\nswaps as fair value hedges. For these hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the cross\\ncurrency swaps related to both time value and cross currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge\\neffectiveness (the excluded components). The initial value of the excluded components of $ 1.0billion as of March\\n31, 2022 will continue to be amortized into Interest expense over the remaining life of the hedging instruments. We\\nestimate that $ 109million will be amortized into Interest expense within the next 12 months.\\n\\nIn addition to the previously mentioned cross currency swaps, we have executed additional cross currency swaps to\\nexchange Euro-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars. These swaps are\\ndesignated as fair value hedges. We record the cross currency swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance\\nsheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the cross currency swaps attributable to changes in\\nthe spot rate of the hedged item and changes in the recorded value of the hedged debt due to changes in spot rates\\nare recorded in the same income statement line item. We present exchange gains and losses from the conversion of\\nforeign currency denominated debt as a part of Interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these\\namounts completely offset each other and nonet gain or loss was recorded.\\n\\nChanges in the fair value of cross currency swaps attributable to time value and cross currency basis spread are\\ninitially recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains or losses on excluded components are\\nrecorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized into Interest expense on a systematic and rational\\nbasis through the swap accrual over the life of the hedging instrument. The amount remaining in Accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges on the date of transition will be reclassified to earnings when the\\nhedged item is recognized in earnings or when it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the amortization of the initial value of the excluded component completely\\noffset the amortization related to the amount remaining in Other comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow\\nhedges. See Note 14 for additional information.\\nForward Starting Interest Rate Swaps\\nWe have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our\\nexposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted transactions. We hedge our exposure to the variability in\\nfuture cash flows based on the expected maturities of the related forecasted debt issuance. We recognize gains and\\nlosses resulting from interest rate movements in Other comprehensive income (loss).\\n                                                        89                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\nTreasury Rate Locks\\nWe have entered into treasury rate locks designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate our interest rate risk on\\nfuture transactions. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in Other comprehensive\\nincome (loss).\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe have designated certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange\\nexposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign\\nexchange rates. The notional amount of Euro-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge was \\u20ac 750million\\nas of both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\nUndesignated Derivatives\\nWe also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not\\nto apply hedge accounting.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the activity of our derivatives not designated in hedging relationships:\\n                                                                                                  \\n                                                                           (dollars in millions)  \\n  Years Ended December 31,                              2022               2021                   \\n \\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 \\n  Foreign Exchange Forwards:                                                                      \\n  Notional value entered into                $  10,689          $  12,604                         \\n  Notional value settled                        10,701             13,077                         \\n  Pre-tax loss recognized in Other income          -97                -62                         \\n  (expense), net                                                                                  \\n  Swaptions:                                                                                      \\n  Notional value sold                            1,000              2,000                         \\n  Notional value settled                         1,000              2,000                         \\n  Pre-tax gain (loss) recognized in                -33                 11                         \\n  Interest expense                                                                                \\n                                                                                                  \\nForeign Exchange Forwards\\nWe enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk\\nrelated to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries.\\nSwaptions\\nWe enter into swaptions to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt.\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash\\ninvestments, short-term and long-term investments, trade receivables, including device payment plan agreement\\nreceivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables, and derivative contracts.\\n\\nCounterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated\\nderivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for\\ncollateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be\\nrequired to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established\\nthresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments\\nand fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash\\ncollateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2022, we did not hold any\\ncollateral. At December 31, 2022, we posted $ 2.3billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under\\ncollateral exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheet.\\nAt December 31, 2021, we held and posted $ 0.1billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of collateral\\nrelated to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current\\nliabilities and Prepaid expenses and other, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. While we may be\\nexposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not\\nexpect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial\\ncondition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.\\n                                     \\n  Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation  \\n                                     \\nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan\\nIn May 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated the\\nCompany's authority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017\\nPlan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of\\nstock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance\\nstock units and other awards. Upon\\n                                                        90                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\napproval of the 2017 Plan, we reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining\\nbut not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are\\ncanceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2022,\\n69million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\\nRestricted Stock Units\\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in threeequal installments on each\\nanniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity\\nawards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of\\neach reporting period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is\\nmeasured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend\\nequivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award\\nvests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In 2020, Verizon\\nannounced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all\\nfull-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements.\\n\\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures\\ndiffer from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated\\ncompensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the\\nvesting period.\\nPerformance Stock Units\\nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the\\nthird year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors\\ndetermines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals\\nhave been achieved over the three-yearperformance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are\\nclassified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not\\nremeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability\\nawards are measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on\\nthe price of Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017\\nPlan have DEUs, which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award vests, and\\nis paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled\\nactivity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes Verizon\\u2019s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity:\\n                                                                                                                   \\n                 Restricted                                         Performan\\u2026                                     \\n                Stock Units                                              Stock                                     \\n                                                                         Units                                     \\n  (shares in                 Equity                  Liability                  Equity                 Liability   \\n  thousands)                 Awards                  Awards                     Awards                 Awards      \\n  Outstandi\\u2026                                                                                                       \\n  January 1,          7,259                  14,713                          \\u2014                 15,551              \\n  2020                                                                                                             \\n  Granted             3,638                  15,161                      4,358                  1,389              \\n  Payments           -3,814                  -9,311                          \\u2014                 -7,160              \\n  Cancelled\\u2026           -182                  -1,004                       -116                   -143              \\n  Outstandi\\u2026                                                                                                       \\n  December            6,901                  19,559                      4,242                  9,637              \\n  31, 2020                                                                                                         \\n  Granted             4,079                  16,845                      5,353                  1,692              \\n  Payments           -3,417                 -10,797                          \\u2014                 -6,718              \\n  Cancelled\\u2026           -784                  -8,317                       -955                   -146              \\n  Outstandi\\u2026                                                                                                       \\n  December            6,779                  17,290                      8,640                  4,465              \\n  31, 2021                                                                                                         \\n  Granted             4,149                  11,309                      5,752                    197              \\n  Payments           -3,313                  -6,363                          \\u2014                 -2,075              \\n  Cancelled\\u2026           -362                  -1,627                       -567                 -2,171              \\n  Outstandi\\u2026                                                                                                       \\n  December            7,253                  20,609                     13,825                    416              \\n  31, 2022                                                                                                         \\n                                                                                                                   \\nAs of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon\\u2019s RSUs and\\nPSUs was approximately $ 604million and is expected to be recognized over approximately 2years.\\n\\nThe equity awards granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $ 53.26, $\\n55.39and $ 57.38per unit, respectively.

These estimates are updated in the\\nfourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event, to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial\\nassumptions.

America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for three years, from August 5, 2023\\nuntil August 1, 2026. Amendments triggered by the collective bargaining negotiations were made to certain pension\\nplans for certain union-represented employees. The impact of the plan amendments was an increase in our defined\\nbenefit pension plans plan obligations of approximately $ 427million, which has been recorded as a net decrease to\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $ 317million (net of taxes of $ 110million). The annual impact of\\nthe amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that will be reclassified to net periodic\\nbenefit cost is minimal.\\n\\nThe reclassifications from the amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of\\ncollective bargaining agreements and plan amendments made in 2016, 2017 and 2018 resulted in a net decrease to net\\nperiodic benefit cost and net increase to pre-tax income of approximately $ 390million during 2022 and $ 708million\\nduring 2021 and 2020.\\nInformation for pension plans with an accumulated

While target allocation percentages will vary over time,\\nthe current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 41% to 51% of the assets have the objective of\\nachieving a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real\\nestate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emerging market debt) and 55% to 65% of the assets are invested as\\nliability hedging assets (where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets better match the interest\\nrate sensitivity of the liability) and a maximum of 10% is in cash. This allocation will shift as funded status\\nimproves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to\\nensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on\\nperceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control processes,\\nthere are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector, industry, geography or company names.\\n\\nPension and healthcare and life

valuation methodologies and inputs used\\nto determine the fair value of each major category of assets.\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), primarily in\\ndiversified portfolios of investment grade money market instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or\\nother valuation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term\\nnature of these investments.\\n\\nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last\\nreported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last\\nreported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued\\nusing matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are\\nvalued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from\\npublished sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes.\\n\\nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net\\nasset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund\\nmanagers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of\\nthe respective plan.\\n\\nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited\\npartnership investments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by\\neither independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market\\ncomparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of\\nthe underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based upon available and current market\\ninformation and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent\\nuncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been\\nused had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material.\\n\\nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices\\nprevailing on the last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from\\npublished sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.\\n\\nHedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager. These\\nfunds are valued in accordance with the terms of their corresponding offering or private placement memoranda.\\n                                                        96                                                         \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nCommingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limited\\npartnership investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not\\nleveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total investments.\\nEmployer Contributions\\nIn 2022, we made nodiscretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $ 53million of contributions to our\\nnonqualified pension plans and $ 692million of contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans.

Tax controversies are ongoing for\\ntax years as early as 2009 in certain states and as early as 2000 outside the U.S. The amount of the liability for\\nunrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations\\nin various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax examinations will conclude or\\nrequire reevaluations of the Company\\u2019s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible\\nchange cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.\\n                                \\n  Note 13.

The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased\\nreaches 100million or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner.\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock\\nunder our authorized share buyback program. At December 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that could be\\npurchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100million.\\nCommon stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and\\nshareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we issued 2.1million, 2.1million and\\n2.3million shares of common stock from treasury stock, which had aggregate values of $ 91million, $ 91million and $\\n101million, respectively.\\nIn connection with our acquisition of TracFone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6million shares of our\\ncommon stock from treasury stock valued at approximately $ 3.0billion. See Note 3 for additional information.\\nNoncontrolling Interests\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Verizon entered into and completed agreements to acquire additional\\ninterests in certain controlled wireless partnerships for cash consideration of $ 508million. Verizon continues to\\nretain controlling financial interest within these partnerships; therefore, the changes in ownership interest were\\naccounted for as equity transactions. This resulted in a reduction of additional paid-in capital of $ 450million,\\nreflected in Other, and a reduction of noncontrolling interest of $ 58million, reflected in Distributions and\\nother, both within our consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Commitments and Contingencies  \\n                                          \\nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings\\nat the state and federal level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and\\nsettlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon establishes an accrual. In none\\nof the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or\\nrange of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical\\nin contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual\\nrecord; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the\\nunpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they\\ndevelop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any\\npending regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it\\ncould have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.\\nVerizon is currently involved in approximately 25federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing\\nvarious patents. Most of these cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary\\ndamages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well.\\nThese cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they\\nare not otherwise resolved.\\nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily\\nprovides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as\\nownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time,\\ncounterparties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and\\nresolve them in the ordinary course of business.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, letters of credit totaling approximately $ 834million, which were executed in the normal\\ncourse of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were\\noutstanding.\\nDuring 2022, Verizon entered into fourrenewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties , in addition\\nto 20signed in previous years . Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-\\ngenerating facility and has a fixed price term of 12to 18years from the commencement of the facility's entry into\\ncommercial operation. Sevenof the facilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under\\ndevelopment. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as\\nenergy is generated by the facilities.\\nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that\\nare enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with\\nterms in excess of one year, total $ 24.5billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase network\\nequipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the\\nordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $ 9.4billion is attributable to\\n2023, $ 6.9billion is attributable to 2024, $ 5.5billion is attributable to 2025, $ 1.4billion is attributable to\\n2026, $ 772million is attributable to 2027 and $ 524million is attributable to years thereafter. These amounts do\\nnot represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the\\n                                                        106                                                        \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nsubject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities\\nto which we are contractually obliged. Since the commitments to purchase programming services from television\\nnetworks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of\\nsubscribers at December 31, 2022, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also\\npurchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.\\n                                                      \\n  Item 9.

In\\nthe third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP)\\nsystem, which will replace many of our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance\\nthe flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information reporting. The\\nimplementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.\\n\\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures\\nwhich, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur,\\nwe will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\nThere were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2022 that\\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\\nreporting.\\n                                                  \\n  Management's Annual Report on Internal Control  \\n  over Financial Reporting                        \\n                                                  \\nThe management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting of Verizon.
